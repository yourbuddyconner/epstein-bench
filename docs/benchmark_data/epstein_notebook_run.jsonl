By the time Shimon Peres, the Nobel Prize-winning prime minister of Israel who helped resolve many of the more intangible issues, died more peacefully aged 93 in 2016, he had become one of the most accomplished statesmen of our age. But perhaps the greatest casualty from that era – when there were genuine expectations on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian divide that the conflict might be resolved peacefully – has been the peace process itself, which today is almost nonexistent. When, for example, I told an Arab ambassador acquaintance I was going to see a preview of the play, he simply remarked: “No one talks about the peace process any more. It doesn’t exist.” This makes Roger’s examination of one of the most unlikely diplomatic dialogues ever undertaken all the more poignant, as it harks back to an era when reconciliation seemed genuinely possible. The task facing the rival delegates when they first meet is a daunting one. For the Israelis, if the fact became known that they were talking to the PLO, the government would most likely fall. For the Palestinians, it would mean an assassin’s bullet. At the heart of this danse macabre stands Rød-Larsen, whom I met on several occasions in Jerusalem in the Nineties when the hard work had begun on implementing the deal. A quiet, patient man, he never seemed to be entirely comfortable with the rough-house atmosphere of the region, where disputes were often more likely to be resolved through rocks and rubber bullets than rational persuasion. Toby Stephens’s portrayal of Rød- Larsen gives him a great deal more zest and personality than I recall, but this neatly nuanced performance is key to the pace of this fast-moving, entertaining take on the events (Rogers has said that, in order to liven up what might otherwise seem a prosaic and convoluted political process, he studied the plays of Noël Coward). My favourite scene from the play is the one where the lead Israeli negotiator, taking a break from the negotiations, entertains his Palestinian counterparts by giving an impersonation of Arafat as an effeminate narcissist, a portrayal I found entirely plausible from my own encounters with the PLO leader, whose vanity knew no bounds. Uri Savir, who was deputed by Peres to run the Israeli side of the negotiations, was someone else I got to know during that period. An urbane multi-linguist of an academic disposition, I generally found Uri to be softly spoken and thoughtful when discussing regional issues. Philip Arditti’s portrayal of him in the play, though, makes him out to be more like the uncompromising, muscular Israeli type, more usually found in the ranks of the security forces than in the diplomatic service. Depictions in theatre of almost anything to do with the Middle East tend to stir strong passions among audiences. I was particularly struck by Rogers’ sympathetic understanding of the Palestinian predicament. “I was very anxious about the combustibility of it,” said Rogers in a recent interview. “I assumed there would be controversy [in America] only because someone would be enraged that I had allowed the ‘other side’ to have their say.” Certainly Peter Polycarpou’s depiction of Ahmed Qurei, the Palestinian finance minister sent by Arafat to make peace, admirably captures the conflicting emotions of enduring the pain of exile while seeking to wreak terrible vengeance on the Israeli occupiers. Indeed, for all the quips and light-hearted banter, Oslo is, at heart, a deeply emotional drama. When the Israelis finally strike a deal with the Palestinians during a telephone call to Arafat’s headquarters in Tunis, they think they can hear music playing in the background. In fact it is the battle-hardened veterans of the PLO sobbing at the prospect of being allowed to return to their homeland. Ultimately, the play is an implicit tragedy about the failure of both sides to build a lasting peace on the basis of the painful concessions made during Reproduced by Gorkana under licence from the NLA (newspapers), CLA (magazines), FT (Financial Times/ft.com) or other copyright owner.

(In 197_, a federal district court recognized a limited right to nude sunbathing in areas that present no conflicts with the rights of others. The decision, despite its limited scope was characterized as a “Magna Carta for nudism.’’) Pornography, like nudity, offends many Americans, but there are those who would ban not only public displays of pornography, but private use as well. They argue that three distinct types of harm are caused by pornography. The first, as with nudity, is that it is offensive to many people who are involuntarily exposed to it. No empirical evidence is required to prove this kind of harm: if people say they are offended, that is the end of the matter. The second is that some people are offended by the mere knowledge that other people, who are not offending by watching it, are watching it in private. Whether this type of what I call “vicarious offensiveness” warrants an except to the First Amendment raises profound legal issues. The third, very different, kind of harm is that pornography is alleged to cause rape and other physical violence against women. This allegation, which if true would warrant legal protection, is hotly disputed and unproven, if not improvable.** group, he might respond by striking back. Hence, such provocatively offensive expressions have been called “fighting words” and have been denied First Amendment protection by some courts over the years. This concept has assumed center stage recently, as some Muslim groups, individuals and even nations have threatened violence in response to the publication of “offensive” books, cartoons and other media critiques of Islam and its prophet. The stakes have also risen. Instead of merely fighting words, some radical Muslims regard insults to the prophet as killing and bombing words. * The issue is somewhat complicated, because it may be true that certain kinds of violent pornography (as well as violent non-pornography) may be contributing factors in certain people’s decision or propensity to rape, just as alcohol or other drugs may be contributing factors. What is undeniably clear is that only a miniscule fraction of men who view pornography go on to rape or commit violence, and that a great many rapists do not view pornography.

Attached and below the same. Dear Jeffrey: As requested, the following addresses your two questions / concerns about our proposed Closer To Truth TV series \"The Science of Sleep and Dreams\": (i) Have there been sufficient breakthroughs in Sleep and Dreams (significantly beyond traditional understandings) to justify a major TV series? (ii) Even if 'yes' to (i), is now the proper time for such a foundational series, or are more years needed for corroborative studies and further research to solidify the breakthroughs? In preparing this response, my primary source is Professor Patrick McNamara, Department of Neurology, Boston University School of Medicine, with whom CTT Producer/Director Peter Getzels and I spoke with at length today. Patrick is one of the leading sleep and dream researchers (he himself more dreams). More importantly, he is perhaps the leading chronicler of the field, with many publications (including 26 entries in related encyclopedias). He is co-editor-in-chief of the \"Encyclopedia of Sleep and Dreams\" (2012) and the sole author of the forthcoming \"An Introduction to the Neuroscience of Sleep and Dreams\" (Cambridge University Press, 2018), which intends to present the latest science and to become a main textbook for graduate courses/seminars. Patrick is a CTT contributor and colleague. When we asked Patrick, his first response — \"This is the ideal time to tell the sleep-and-dreams story\" — and he cited (in essence) your two questions, in that (i) the multiple breakthroughs are now sufficiently well corroborated by numerous independent labs such that a substantial foundation for the new, deeper understanding of sleep and dreams is now for the first time (over the past few years) confirmed and established, and (ii) there are now interesting application and critical clinical questions to pose, explore and pursue, such as for the treatment of various mental-related illnesses that have known sleep-related syndromes (e.g., PTSD and Depression). To understand the significance of recent breakthroughs, a defining characteristic of sleep and dreams is that there are two distinct kinds of sleep — REM (rapid-eye-movement) Sleep and NREM (non-rapid-eye- movement) Sleep. Most dreams are associated with REM sleep (though complex). The eye movement gives the eponymous name, but a more important designation defines the two stages in terms of brain waves (electroencephalograph — EEG): REM is Fast-Wave Sleep (similar to the waking state) and NREM Sleep is Slow-Wave Sleep (very different from the waking state). This difference between REM and NREM sleep has been known since 1953 (different EEGs since 1937), but its deep significance has only been discovered and confirmed in very recent years (as explained below). Following are the key areas of breakthrough in sleep and dreams (from Patrick). Patrick states that these are HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025191 now reproducible, non-controversial, and well-accepted among experts, although still not appreciated by the public - hence the high value of our CTT TV series. The organizing idea is why and how are sleep and dreams essential for normal memory consolidation and bodily health / well-being. Memory Consolidation. There is a fundamental difference between REM and NREM Sleep for memory consolidation: REM is for emotional memories, whereas NREM is for declarative and procedural memories. Hence, understanding and dealing with REM emotional memories can lead to treatment for the many neuropsychiatric illnesses that have sleep/dream-related disorders or syndromes (Parkinson's Disease, Anxiety, Substance Abuse, many sleep disorders such as Nightmare Disorder, etc., in addition to PTSD and Depression). Research shows bi-directional causality between neuropsychiatric disorders and sleep disorders. This is a superb example of how fundamental science breakthroughs lead to clinical breakthroughs. This fact that REM is associated with emotional memories is nicely consistent with the apparent psychotic nature of dreams, because in REM Sleep the frontal cortex is 'down-regulated' (and the frontal cortex is associated with rational planning, reflection, controlling impulses), while in REM Sleep the limbic system is 'up-regulated\" (and the limbic system is associated with emotions and feelings) — see Neuroimaging below. This is why dream states flood the ego with emotional fantasies without rational control. However, it is also true that the limbic system enables creative ideas, thus grounding in science the long-suspected idea that sleep and dreams can enhance creativity. As Dr. Robert Stickgold, our other advisor on the series, wrote: \"It would be nice if we could talk about sleep and memory as if there were only one type of memory and one type of sleep. But this is far from the case. Sleep and memory each comes in many forms, and furthermore, memories can go through multiple forms of post-encoding processing that must be individually addressed.\" Immunity / Immune System. Strengthening the immune system is now a proven product of NREM sleep. Discerning the evolutionary basis for this is a key research project (i.e., it seems counter-intuitive that sleeping facilitates fitness for survival in that predators lurked in the jungles and on the plains so that going unconscious during sleep does not, at first glance, seem especially adaptive). Studies of sleep in various non-human animals reveals a direct relationship between longer periods of NREM (Slow-Wave) Sleep and a stronger immune system, especially in fighting parasites. NREM Sleep releases molecules that fight inflection; NREM Sleep works for the maintenance, repair and activation of the immune system. (This gives scientific rationale for the need or desire to sleep during illnesses.) Related are \"genetic conflict\" studies with respect to REM and NREM, showing differences in heredity between material and paternal lines, and differences between males and females in which genes get \"imprinted\". Neuroplasticity. Exciting recent research has reversed the century-long conventional wisdom that new neurons are never created in adult animals/humans. The development of new neurons — neuronogenesis — is a vital part of maintaining normal brain and mental functioning. New neurons are being created, importantly, in the hippocampus (brain organ where new memories are encoded) — but, remarkably, the neuronogensis in the hippocampus occurs only/largely during REM Sleep — a stunning finding. This is another reason why REM sleep is needed for emotional memory consolidation (normal functioning). Dream-Content. Although dreams have sparked human fascination and fantasy for thousands of years, only in very recent years, have large-scale surveys been conducted with rigorous design, classifications and statistical analysis. Literally hundreds of thousands of dreams are enabling statistically significant theories, including cross-cultural analyses (similarities and differences). Dream-posting sites have revolutionized size and structure of dream data sets. This enables, for the first time, longitudinal studies of dreams over time. Patterns are repeated. For example, in general, the dreams of males and females differ in fundamental ways. Males will engage in fighting with other males; females with both males and females. Male dreamers are often the initiator of fights and the fights are usually physical. Females fight verbally. Aggressiveness by the dreamer is almost always in REM Sleep, rarely in NREM Sleep. (Why is a continuing question.) \"Lucid Dreaming\" is a new area of fascinating research. Lucid Dreaming is where the dreamer \"knows\" that HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025192 he/she is dreaming while dreaming (a talent that a small minority possesses but more can be trained/developed). Lucid dreamers, while sleeping, can now communicate with experimenters by altering their brain activity and thus becoming detectable by neuroimaging techniques (see below). Neuroimaging. Finally, neuroimaging technology has enabled many of these breakthroughs. As such, it is itself a methodological breakthrough that has enabled these other content breakthroughs. Neuroimaging now enables detailed location of the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of REM and NREM Sleep. In REM Sleep, the dorsolateral, frontal cortex is \"down-regulated\", whereas the limbic system is \"up-regulated\", showing the physiological basis for the emotional, wild-fantasies of dreams (see above). (Neuroimaging will enable good visual images for the TV series without extra costs.) Patrick stresses that while these breakthroughs form, for the first time, a solid foundation for understanding sleep and dreams, they also open opportunities to dig deeper into the \"purpose\" of sleep and dreams, as well as engender a new series of questions and directions (e.g., clinical treatments of illnesses). Attached is Patrick's quick compiling of summaries of a few recent leading research papers (2009 — 2017, especially 2015-2017). You'd enjoy speaking with him, if you want.

And it would exclude the post-1967 neighborhoods inside the expanded city limits of Jerusalem. Like his other moves, it was also dismissed as insignificant by the Palestinians. Though there was a formal restarting of the talks, they went almost nowhere during the period of the freeze, which Bibi cited as a reason for not extending it further. From then on, the negotiations produced even less. I didn’t buy the narrative that this was entirely Bibi’s fault. Abu Mazen remained steadfastly, deliberately passive. Obviously not inclined to take the risk of further widening his rift with Hamas in Gaza, he was content to echo the Obama administration’s argument that nothing could happen until there was a settlement freeze. Once the freeze was announced, he went through the motions, avoiding all the difficult issues, in the expectation Washington would ensure the freeze was renewed. President Obama’s initial Mideast moves had made it much easier for Abu Mazen to avoid any serious engagement. In contrast to past presidents, Obama had placed almost all of the onus for progress on Israel. But the end result also suited Bibi. Though I never entirely gave up hope of persuading him it was in Israel’s interest to seek a resolution of our conflict with the Palestinians, it became more evident as the months went on that his aim was simply to keep things ticking over, and avoid any major new crisis. He appointed an old personal friend — a corporate lawyer named Yitzhak Molcho — as our negotiator. I finally realized how pointless the exercise was when, during a visit to the United States, I found myself in New York at the same time as Molcho. We met at the Israeli consulate. We spoke in detail about the state of the negotiations. With Molcho still in the room, I phoned Bibi in Jerusalem on the secure phone line. I said I’d just been updated on the talks, and it seemed clear there were a number of suggestions Israel could make, with no domestic political risk but with every prospect of improving the atmosphere and accelerating progress. “Yitzhak is one of Israel’s top lawyers,” I said. “He’s struck dozens of deals in his life. But he strikes a deal when that’s what his client wants. You are the client. If you tell him: bring me back the best deal you can — not a peace treaty, just a deal on a specific issue — he’ Il do it. But if his brief is simply to negotiate, he can go on negotiating forever. And it’s pretty clear me that’s his brief.” Bibi insisted I was wrong. He said that what I saw as time-wasting was simple prudence, to make sure the negotiations bore fruit. But his approach never changed.

In February, the Miami Herald filed a federal court motion in the Southern District of New York, seeking access to documents that were sealed in the Maxwell case. The motion, which was not opposed by Roberts, could have cast light on the full scope of Epstein’s possible sex trafficking operation, who was involved and whether it was covered up. Maxwell has opposed the Herald’s motion, which was denied in August. The Herald is appealing. Today, Epstein has a new private jet, which takes him around the world. Flight records show that he spends most of his time on his private island, Little St. James in the U.S. Virgin Islands, which he now lists as his permanent residence. He is registered in New York and the U.S. Virgin Islands as a sex offender. New Mexico, where he owns a sprawling ranch, does not list him as a convicted sex offender. As part of its investigation, the Herald learned that in 2013, the federal government conceded that it had given Epstein what it called “valuable consideration” for information he provided to the FBI as part of his plea deal. The documents do not elaborate, but Epstein — a hedge fund manager who once worked for the investment firm Bear Stearns — was listed as a key investor who lost money in the financial crash of 2008. Francey Hakes, a former federal child sex crimes prosecutor, said any consideration the government gave to Epstein should be made public. “The public has a right to know why he gota slap on the wrist, and what was the interest that was so great that allowed him to not get prosecuted?” j 1 ~~.” J m | Paul https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article2 19494920 html 4/3/2019 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017814", "metadata": {"source_filename": "IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017814.txt", "parent_doc_id": "IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017814.txt", "chunk_index": 0, "entities": ["Today Epstein", "February", "Page", "U.S Virgin Islands", "HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017814", "Miami Herald Page", "British", "FBI", "Herald’s", "Menninger", "New Mexico", "Document", "Southern District", "New York", "Even", "Maxwell", "Epstein’s", "Francey Hakes", "Laura Menninger", "Jeffrey Epstein", "Roberts", "Filed", "Epstein", "August The Herald", "Paul", "Maxwell’s", "Case", "Miami Herald", "Flight", "Bear Stearns", "Little St James", "Herald"]}}], "reference_answer": {"text": "The 10-month freeze could lead tabloids to sensationalize the situation to attract readers, as their motive is to sell papers and advertisements without regard for truth, potentially distorting the narrative around the negotiations.", "structured": null, "metadata": {}}}

The Governor’s ball, held above the Kodak Theater, recreates the Mocambo-Ciro’s niteries of the 1930’s and 40’s, using a palette of teal and white. Three bands alternate musical styles as hungry guests wolf down wolfgang Puck’s delicious food. The winners triumphantly sachet around the room holding their heavy eight pound gold statues. An hour later there is a migration to the famous Vanity Fair party hosted by Graydon Carter at the Sunset Tower Hotel owned by Jeff Klein. One celebrity after another poses in front of the green hedge standing in the middle of the circular Vanity Fair logo to record their devotion and support to Graydon and the magazine. There’s a hierarchy of arrival times. The inner circle of Graydon’s 150 best friends attend a seated dinner and viewing of the show at 5pm. They include Barry Diller and Diane Von Furstenberg, Francis Ford Coppola, Jon Hamm and Jennifer westfeldt, Betsey Bloomingdale, Tory Burch and Lyor Cohen, Tom Ford, Sandy Gallin, Mitch Glazer and Kelly Lynch, Carolina and Reinaldo Herrera, L’Wren Scott and Sir Mick Jagger, Naomi Watts and Live Schreiber, Wendi Stark, Judd Apatow, Jackie and Joan Collins, George Hammilton, Donna Karan and Steve Martin. The best and the brightest talent in town arrive at 9pm. They are Justin Bieber and his date Selena Gomez, Andrew Garfield, Jude Law, Vera Farmiga, Armie Hammer, Jennifer Lawrence, Kevin Spacey, Charlize Theron, Anne Hathaway, Hailee Steinfield,Taylor Hackford and Helen Mirren, Scarlett Johansson, Michelle williams, Isla Fischer and Sasha Baron Cohen, Jane Fonda after her play, “33 Variations”, Melania and Donald Trump whom I introduce to David 0.

Too bad James Franco didn’t know because he is presently sitting on a commercial flight back to school, skipping his own after party. Social standings of the rest of the guests are determined by half hour increments. Every other person previously mentioned in the story is here. VF’s Beth Kseniak and Matt Ullian tell me the list is cut down to 800 this year. At 11:30pm there is another celebrity migration up the hill to Madonna manager Guy Oseary’s house. One should note that earlier in the evening Madonna came down the hill to pose in a risqué outfit with daughter Lourdes in front of the green hedge. Madonna and co-host Demi Moore are able to lure the créme de la créme with the promise of fabulous music, dancing and no cameras. Those reported on their dance floor include Ryan Phillippe with Amanda Syedfried, who were making out all night and Phillippe’s ex-wife Reese Witherspoon and new fiancé Jim Toth.

By the time Shimon Peres, the Nobel Prize-winning prime minister of Israel who helped resolve many of the more intangible issues, died more peacefully aged 93 in 2016, he had become one of the most accomplished statesmen of our age. But perhaps the greatest casualty from that era – when there were genuine expectations on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian divide that the conflict might be resolved peacefully – has been the peace process itself, which today is almost nonexistent. When, for example, I told an Arab ambassador acquaintance I was going to see a preview of the play, he simply remarked: “No one talks about the peace process any more. It doesn’t exist.” This makes Roger’s examination of one of the most unlikely diplomatic dialogues ever undertaken all the more poignant, as it harks back to an era when reconciliation seemed genuinely possible. The task facing the rival delegates when they first meet is a daunting one. For the Israelis, if the fact became known that they were talking to the PLO, the government would most likely fall. For the Palestinians, it would mean an assassin’s bullet. At the heart of this danse macabre stands Rød-Larsen, whom I met on several occasions in Jerusalem in the Nineties when the hard work had begun on implementing the deal. A quiet, patient man, he never seemed to be entirely comfortable with the rough-house atmosphere of the region, where disputes were often more likely to be resolved through rocks and rubber bullets than rational persuasion. Toby Stephens’s portrayal of Rød- Larsen gives him a great deal more zest and personality than I recall, but this neatly nuanced performance is key to the pace of this fast-moving, entertaining take on the events (Rogers has said that, in order to liven up what might otherwise seem a prosaic and convoluted political process, he studied the plays of Noël Coward). My favourite scene from the play is the one where the lead Israeli negotiator, taking a break from the negotiations, entertains his Palestinian counterparts by giving an impersonation of Arafat as an effeminate narcissist, a portrayal I found entirely plausible from my own encounters with the PLO leader, whose vanity knew no bounds. Uri Savir, who was deputed by Peres to run the Israeli side of the negotiations, was someone else I got to know during that period. An urbane multi-linguist of an academic disposition, I generally found Uri to be softly spoken and thoughtful when discussing regional issues. Philip Arditti’s portrayal of him in the play, though, makes him out to be more like the uncompromising, muscular Israeli type, more usually found in the ranks of the security forces than in the diplomatic service. Depictions in theatre of almost anything to do with the Middle East tend to stir strong passions among audiences. I was particularly struck by Rogers’ sympathetic understanding of the Palestinian predicament. “I was very anxious about the combustibility of it,” said Rogers in a recent interview. “I assumed there would be controversy [in America] only because someone would be enraged that I had allowed the ‘other side’ to have their say.” Certainly Peter Polycarpou’s depiction of Ahmed Qurei, the Palestinian finance minister sent by Arafat to make peace, admirably captures the conflicting emotions of enduring the pain of exile while seeking to wreak terrible vengeance on the Israeli occupiers. Indeed, for all the quips and light-hearted banter, Oslo is, at heart, a deeply emotional drama. When the Israelis finally strike a deal with the Palestinians during a telephone call to Arafat’s headquarters in Tunis, they think they can hear music playing in the background. In fact it is the battle-hardened veterans of the PLO sobbing at the prospect of being allowed to return to their homeland. Ultimately, the play is an implicit tragedy about the failure of both sides to build a lasting peace on the basis of the painful concessions made during Reproduced by Gorkana under licence from the NLA (newspapers), CLA (magazines), FT (Financial Times/ft.com) or other copyright owner.

(In 197_, a federal district court recognized a limited right to nude sunbathing in areas that present no conflicts with the rights of others. The decision, despite its limited scope was characterized as a “Magna Carta for nudism.’’) Pornography, like nudity, offends many Americans, but there are those who would ban not only public displays of pornography, but private use as well. They argue that three distinct types of harm are caused by pornography. The first, as with nudity, is that it is offensive to many people who are involuntarily exposed to it. No empirical evidence is required to prove this kind of harm: if people say they are offended, that is the end of the matter. The second is that some people are offended by the mere knowledge that other people, who are not offending by watching it, are watching it in private. Whether this type of what I call “vicarious offensiveness” warrants an except to the First Amendment raises profound legal issues. The third, very different, kind of harm is that pornography is alleged to cause rape and other physical violence against women. This allegation, which if true would warrant legal protection, is hotly disputed and unproven, if not improvable.** group, he might respond by striking back. Hence, such provocatively offensive expressions have been called “fighting words” and have been denied First Amendment protection by some courts over the years. This concept has assumed center stage recently, as some Muslim groups, individuals and even nations have threatened violence in response to the publication of “offensive” books, cartoons and other media critiques of Islam and its prophet. The stakes have also risen. Instead of merely fighting words, some radical Muslims regard insults to the prophet as killing and bombing words. * The issue is somewhat complicated, because it may be true that certain kinds of violent pornography (as well as violent non-pornography) may be contributing factors in certain people’s decision or propensity to rape, just as alcohol or other drugs may be contributing factors. What is undeniably clear is that only a miniscule fraction of men who view pornography go on to rape or commit violence, and that a great many rapists do not view pornography.

Attached and below the same. Dear Jeffrey: As requested, the following addresses your two questions / concerns about our proposed Closer To Truth TV series \"The Science of Sleep and Dreams\": (i) Have there been sufficient breakthroughs in Sleep and Dreams (significantly beyond traditional understandings) to justify a major TV series? (ii) Even if 'yes' to (i), is now the proper time for such a foundational series, or are more years needed for corroborative studies and further research to solidify the breakthroughs? In preparing this response, my primary source is Professor Patrick McNamara, Department of Neurology, Boston University School of Medicine, with whom CTT Producer/Director Peter Getzels and I spoke with at length today. Patrick is one of the leading sleep and dream researchers (he himself more dreams). More importantly, he is perhaps the leading chronicler of the field, with many publications (including 26 entries in related encyclopedias). He is co-editor-in-chief of the \"Encyclopedia of Sleep and Dreams\" (2012) and the sole author of the forthcoming \"An Introduction to the Neuroscience of Sleep and Dreams\" (Cambridge University Press, 2018), which intends to present the latest science and to become a main textbook for graduate courses/seminars. Patrick is a CTT contributor and colleague. When we asked Patrick, his first response — \"This is the ideal time to tell the sleep-and-dreams story\" — and he cited (in essence) your two questions, in that (i) the multiple breakthroughs are now sufficiently well corroborated by numerous independent labs such that a substantial foundation for the new, deeper understanding of sleep and dreams is now for the first time (over the past few years) confirmed and established, and (ii) there are now interesting application and critical clinical questions to pose, explore and pursue, such as for the treatment of various mental-related illnesses that have known sleep-related syndromes (e.g., PTSD and Depression). To understand the significance of recent breakthroughs, a defining characteristic of sleep and dreams is that there are two distinct kinds of sleep — REM (rapid-eye-movement) Sleep and NREM (non-rapid-eye- movement) Sleep. Most dreams are associated with REM sleep (though complex). The eye movement gives the eponymous name, but a more important designation defines the two stages in terms of brain waves (electroencephalograph — EEG): REM is Fast-Wave Sleep (similar to the waking state) and NREM Sleep is Slow-Wave Sleep (very different from the waking state). This difference between REM and NREM sleep has been known since 1953 (different EEGs since 1937), but its deep significance has only been discovered and confirmed in very recent years (as explained below). Following are the key areas of breakthrough in sleep and dreams (from Patrick). Patrick states that these are HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025191 now reproducible, non-controversial, and well-accepted among experts, although still not appreciated by the public - hence the high value of our CTT TV series. The organizing idea is why and how are sleep and dreams essential for normal memory consolidation and bodily health / well-being. Memory Consolidation. There is a fundamental difference between REM and NREM Sleep for memory consolidation: REM is for emotional memories, whereas NREM is for declarative and procedural memories. Hence, understanding and dealing with REM emotional memories can lead to treatment for the many neuropsychiatric illnesses that have sleep/dream-related disorders or syndromes (Parkinson's Disease, Anxiety, Substance Abuse, many sleep disorders such as Nightmare Disorder, etc., in addition to PTSD and Depression). Research shows bi-directional causality between neuropsychiatric disorders and sleep disorders. This is a superb example of how fundamental science breakthroughs lead to clinical breakthroughs. This fact that REM is associated with emotional memories is nicely consistent with the apparent psychotic nature of dreams, because in REM Sleep the frontal cortex is 'down-regulated' (and the frontal cortex is associated with rational planning, reflection, controlling impulses), while in REM Sleep the limbic system is 'up-regulated\" (and the limbic system is associated with emotions and feelings) — see Neuroimaging below. This is why dream states flood the ego with emotional fantasies without rational control. However, it is also true that the limbic system enables creative ideas, thus grounding in science the long-suspected idea that sleep and dreams can enhance creativity. As Dr. Robert Stickgold, our other advisor on the series, wrote: \"It would be nice if we could talk about sleep and memory as if there were only one type of memory and one type of sleep. But this is far from the case. Sleep and memory each comes in many forms, and furthermore, memories can go through multiple forms of post-encoding processing that must be individually addressed.\" Immunity / Immune System. Strengthening the immune system is now a proven product of NREM sleep. Discerning the evolutionary basis for this is a key research project (i.e., it seems counter-intuitive that sleeping facilitates fitness for survival in that predators lurked in the jungles and on the plains so that going unconscious during sleep does not, at first glance, seem especially adaptive). Studies of sleep in various non-human animals reveals a direct relationship between longer periods of NREM (Slow-Wave) Sleep and a stronger immune system, especially in fighting parasites. NREM Sleep releases molecules that fight inflection; NREM Sleep works for the maintenance, repair and activation of the immune system. (This gives scientific rationale for the need or desire to sleep during illnesses.) Related are \"genetic conflict\" studies with respect to REM and NREM, showing differences in heredity between material and paternal lines, and differences between males and females in which genes get \"imprinted\". Neuroplasticity. Exciting recent research has reversed the century-long conventional wisdom that new neurons are never created in adult animals/humans. The development of new neurons — neuronogenesis — is a vital part of maintaining normal brain and mental functioning. New neurons are being created, importantly, in the hippocampus (brain organ where new memories are encoded) — but, remarkably, the neuronogensis in the hippocampus occurs only/largely during REM Sleep — a stunning finding. This is another reason why REM sleep is needed for emotional memory consolidation (normal functioning). Dream-Content. Although dreams have sparked human fascination and fantasy for thousands of years, only in very recent years, have large-scale surveys been conducted with rigorous design, classifications and statistical analysis. Literally hundreds of thousands of dreams are enabling statistically significant theories, including cross-cultural analyses (similarities and differences). Dream-posting sites have revolutionized size and structure of dream data sets. This enables, for the first time, longitudinal studies of dreams over time. Patterns are repeated. For example, in general, the dreams of males and females differ in fundamental ways. Males will engage in fighting with other males; females with both males and females. Male dreamers are often the initiator of fights and the fights are usually physical. Females fight verbally. Aggressiveness by the dreamer is almost always in REM Sleep, rarely in NREM Sleep. (Why is a continuing question.) \"Lucid Dreaming\" is a new area of fascinating research. Lucid Dreaming is where the dreamer \"knows\" that HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025192 he/she is dreaming while dreaming (a talent that a small minority possesses but more can be trained/developed). Lucid dreamers, while sleeping, can now communicate with experimenters by altering their brain activity and thus becoming detectable by neuroimaging techniques (see below). Neuroimaging. Finally, neuroimaging technology has enabled many of these breakthroughs. As such, it is itself a methodological breakthrough that has enabled these other content breakthroughs. Neuroimaging now enables detailed location of the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of REM and NREM Sleep. In REM Sleep, the dorsolateral, frontal cortex is \"down-regulated\", whereas the limbic system is \"up-regulated\", showing the physiological basis for the emotional, wild-fantasies of dreams (see above). (Neuroimaging will enable good visual images for the TV series without extra costs.) Patrick stresses that while these breakthroughs form, for the first time, a solid foundation for understanding sleep and dreams, they also open opportunities to dig deeper into the \"purpose\" of sleep and dreams, as well as engender a new series of questions and directions (e.g., clinical treatments of illnesses). Attached is Patrick's quick compiling of summaries of a few recent leading research papers (2009 — 2017, especially 2015-2017). You'd enjoy speaking with him, if you want.

The freeze would not be open- ended, but last for 10 months, as a way of boosting the effort to restart negotiations. It would apply to new construction, not work already underway. And it would exclude the post-1967 neighborhoods inside the expanded city limits of Jerusalem. Like his other moves, it was also dismissed as insignificant by the Palestinians. Though there was a formal restarting of the talks, they went almost nowhere during the period of the freeze, which Bibi cited as a reason for not extending it further. From then on, the negotiations produced even less. I didn’t buy the narrative that this was entirely Bibi’s fault. Abu Mazen remained steadfastly, deliberately passive. Obviously not inclined to take the risk of further widening his rift with Hamas in Gaza, he was content to echo the Obama administration’s argument that nothing could happen until there was a settlement freeze. Once the freeze was announced, he went through the motions, avoiding all the difficult issues, in the expectation Washington would ensure the freeze was renewed. President Obama’s initial Mideast moves had made it much easier for Abu Mazen to avoid any serious engagement. In contrast to past presidents, Obama had placed almost all of the onus for progress on Israel. But the end result also suited Bibi. Though I never entirely gave up hope of persuading him it was in Israel’s interest to seek a resolution of our conflict with the Palestinians, it became more evident as the months went on that his aim was simply to keep things ticking over, and avoid any major new crisis. He appointed an old personal friend — a corporate lawyer named Yitzhak Molcho — as our negotiator. I finally realized how pointless the exercise was when, during a visit to the United States, I found myself in New York at the same time as Molcho. We met at the Israeli consulate. We spoke in detail about the state of the negotiations. With Molcho still in the room, I phoned Bibi in Jerusalem on the secure phone line. I said I’d just been updated on the talks, and it seemed clear there were a number of suggestions Israel could make, with no domestic political risk but with every prospect of improving the atmosphere and accelerating progress. “Yitzhak is one of Israel’s top lawyers,” I said. “He’s struck dozens of deals in his life. But he strikes a deal when that’s what his client wants. You are the client. If you tell him: bring me back the best deal you can — not a peace treaty, just a deal on a specific issue — he’ Il do it. But if his brief is simply to negotiate, he can go on negotiating forever. And it’s pretty clear me that’s his brief.” Bibi insisted I was wrong. He said that what I saw as time-wasting was simple prudence, to make sure the negotiations bore fruit. But his approach never changed.

In February, the Miami Herald filed a federal court motion in the Southern District of New York, seeking access to documents that were sealed in the Maxwell case. The motion, which was not opposed by Roberts, could have cast light on the full scope of Epstein’s possible sex trafficking operation, who was involved and whether it was covered up. Maxwell has opposed the Herald’s motion, which was denied in August. The Herald is appealing. Today, Epstein has a new private jet, which takes him around the world. Flight records show that he spends most of his time on his private island, Little St. James in the U.S. Virgin Islands, which he now lists as his permanent residence. He is registered in New York and the U.S. Virgin Islands as a sex offender. New Mexico, where he owns a sprawling ranch, does not list him as a convicted sex offender. As part of its investigation, the Herald learned that in 2013, the federal government conceded that it had given Epstein what it called “valuable consideration” for information he provided to the FBI as part of his plea deal. The documents do not elaborate, but Epstein — a hedge fund manager who once worked for the investment firm Bear Stearns — was listed as a key investor who lost money in the financial crash of 2008. Francey Hakes, a former federal child sex crimes prosecutor, said any consideration the government gave to Epstein should be made public. “The public has a right to know why he gota slap on the wrist, and what was the interest that was so great that allowed him to not get prosecuted?” j 1 ~~.” J m | Paul https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article2 19494920 html 4/3/2019 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017814", "metadata": {"source_filename": "IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017814.txt", "parent_doc_id": "IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017814.txt", "chunk_index": 0, "entities": ["Today Epstein", "February", "Page", "U.S Virgin Islands", "HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017814", "Miami Herald Page", "British", "FBI", "Herald’s", "Menninger", "New Mexico", "Document", "Southern District", "New York", "Even", "Maxwell", "Epstein’s", "Francey Hakes", "Laura Menninger", "Jeffrey Epstein", "Roberts", "Filed", "Epstein", "August The Herald", "Paul", "Maxwell’s", "Case", "Miami Herald", "Flight", "Bear Stearns", "Little St James", "Herald"]}}], "reference_answer": {"text": "The 10-month freeze could lead tabloids to sensationalize the situation to attract readers, as their motive is to sell papers and advertisements without regard for truth, potentially distorting the narrative around the negotiations.", "structured": null, "metadata": {}}}

The Governor’s ball, held above the Kodak Theater, recreates the Mocambo-Ciro’s niteries of the 1930’s and 40’s, using a palette of teal and white. Three bands alternate musical styles as hungry guests wolf down wolfgang Puck’s delicious food. The winners triumphantly sachet around the room holding their heavy eight pound gold statues. An hour later there is a migration to the famous Vanity Fair party hosted by Graydon Carter at the Sunset Tower Hotel owned by Jeff Klein. One celebrity after another poses in front of the green hedge standing in the middle of the circular Vanity Fair logo to record their devotion and support to Graydon and the magazine. There’s a hierarchy of arrival times. The inner circle of Graydon’s 150 best friends attend a seated dinner and viewing of the show at 5pm. They include Barry Diller and Diane Von Furstenberg, Francis Ford Coppola, Jon Hamm and Jennifer westfeldt, Betsey Bloomingdale, Tory Burch and Lyor Cohen, Tom Ford, Sandy Gallin, Mitch Glazer and Kelly Lynch, Carolina and Reinaldo Herrera, L’Wren Scott and Sir Mick Jagger, Naomi Watts and Live Schreiber, Wendi Stark, Judd Apatow, Jackie and Joan Collins, George Hammilton, Donna Karan and Steve Martin. The best and the brightest talent in town arrive at 9pm. They are Justin Bieber and his date Selena Gomez, Andrew Garfield, Jude Law, Vera Farmiga, Armie Hammer, Jennifer Lawrence, Kevin Spacey, Charlize Theron, Anne Hathaway, Hailee Steinfield,Taylor Hackford and Helen Mirren, Scarlett Johansson, Michelle williams, Isla Fischer and Sasha Baron Cohen, Jane Fonda after her play, “33 Variations”, Melania and Donald Trump whom I introduce to David 0. Russell as The Trumpster gushes about “The Fighter”. Donald offers me a ride home on his plane. He is leaving in ten minutes. Too bad James Franco didn’t know because he is presently sitting on a commercial flight back to school, skipping his own after party. Social standings of the rest of the guests are determined by half hour increments. Every other person previously mentioned in the story is here. VF’s Beth Kseniak and Matt Ullian tell me the list is cut down to 800 this year. At 11:30pm there is another celebrity migration up the hill to Madonna manager Guy Oseary’s house. One should note that earlier in the evening Madonna came down the hill to pose in a risqué outfit with daughter Lourdes in front of the green hedge. Madonna and co-host Demi Moore are able to lure the créme de la créme with the promise of fabulous music, dancing and no cameras. Those reported on their dance floor include Ryan Phillippe with Amanda Syedfried, who were making out all night and Phillippe’s ex-wife Reese Witherspoon and new fiancé Jim Toth. They pregnant Natalie Portman and choreographer Benjamin Millepied, Mick Jagger, Tom Hanks, Sean Penn, Ralph Feinnes, Mila Kunis, Cameron Diaz, Gwyneth Paltrow and Renee Zellweger and Bradley Cooper boogie til dawn. A winner’s work is never done. Colin Firth, Tom Hooper and David Seidler show up at 4:30am at The Four Seasons Hotel for a live broadcast on The Today Show with Meredith Vieira. Functioning on an adrenalin rush, they are back at the Kodak Theater with Geoffrey Rush to appear on Oprah’s live broadcast.
