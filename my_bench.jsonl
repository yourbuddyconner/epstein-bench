(In 197_, a federal district court recognized a limited right to nude sunbathing in areas that present no conflicts with the rights of others. The decision, despite its limited scope was characterized as a “Magna Carta for nudism.’’) Pornography, like nudity, offends many Americans, but there are those who would ban not only public displays of pornography, but private use as well. They argue that three distinct types of harm are caused by pornography. The first, as with nudity, is that it is offensive to many people who are involuntarily exposed to it. No empirical evidence is required to prove this kind of harm: if people say they are offended, that is the end of the matter. The second is that some people are offended by the mere knowledge that other people, who are not offending by watching it, are watching it in private. Whether this type of what I call “vicarious offensiveness” warrants an except to the First Amendment raises profound legal issues. The third, very different, kind of harm is that pornography is alleged to cause rape and other physical violence against women. This allegation, which if true would warrant legal protection, is hotly disputed and unproven, if not improvable.** group, he might respond by striking back. Hence, such provocatively offensive expressions have been called “fighting words” and have been denied First Amendment protection by some courts over the years. This concept has assumed center stage recently, as some Muslim groups, individuals and even nations have threatened violence in response to the publication of “offensive” books, cartoons and other media critiques of Islam and its prophet. The stakes have also risen. Instead of merely fighting words, some radical Muslims regard insults to the prophet as killing and bombing words. * The issue is somewhat complicated, because it may be true that certain kinds of violent pornography (as well as violent non-pornography) may be contributing factors in certain people’s decision or propensity to rape, just as alcohol or other drugs may be contributing factors. What is undeniably clear is that only a miniscule fraction of men who view pornography go on to rape or commit violence, and that a great many rapists do not view pornography.

By the time Shimon Peres, the Nobel Prize-winning prime minister of Israel who helped resolve many of the more intangible issues, died more peacefully aged 93 in 2016, he had become one of the most accomplished statesmen of our age. But perhaps the greatest casualty from that era – when there were genuine expectations on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian divide that the conflict might be resolved peacefully – has been the peace process itself, which today is almost nonexistent. When, for example, I told an Arab ambassador acquaintance I was going to see a preview of the play, he simply remarked: “No one talks about the peace process any more. It doesn’t exist.” This makes Roger’s examination of one of the most unlikely diplomatic dialogues ever undertaken all the more poignant, as it harks back to an era when reconciliation seemed genuinely possible. The task facing the rival delegates when they first meet is a daunting one. For the Israelis, if the fact became known that they were talking to the PLO, the government would most likely fall. For the Palestinians, it would mean an assassin’s bullet. At the heart of this danse macabre stands Rød-Larsen, whom I met on several occasions in Jerusalem in the Nineties when the hard work had begun on implementing the deal. A quiet, patient man, he never seemed to be entirely comfortable with the rough-house atmosphere of the region, where disputes were often more likely to be resolved through rocks and rubber bullets than rational persuasion. Toby Stephens’s portrayal of Rød- Larsen gives him a great deal more zest and personality than I recall, but this neatly nuanced performance is key to the pace of this fast-moving, entertaining take on the events (Rogers has said that, in order to liven up what might otherwise seem a prosaic and convoluted political process, he studied the plays of Noël Coward). My favourite scene from the play is the one where the lead Israeli negotiator, taking a break from the negotiations, entertains his Palestinian counterparts by giving an impersonation of Arafat as an effeminate narcissist, a portrayal I found entirely plausible from my own encounters with the PLO leader, whose vanity knew no bounds. Uri Savir, who was deputed by Peres to run the Israeli side of the negotiations, was someone else I got to know during that period. An urbane multi-linguist of an academic disposition, I generally found Uri to be softly spoken and thoughtful when discussing regional issues. Philip Arditti’s portrayal of him in the play, though, makes him out to be more like the uncompromising, muscular Israeli type, more usually found in the ranks of the security forces than in the diplomatic service. Depictions in theatre of almost anything to do with the Middle East tend to stir strong passions among audiences. I was particularly struck by Rogers’ sympathetic understanding of the Palestinian predicament. “I was very anxious about the combustibility of it,” said Rogers in a recent interview. “I assumed there would be controversy [in America] only because someone would be enraged that I had allowed the ‘other side’ to have their say.” Certainly Peter Polycarpou’s depiction of Ahmed Qurei, the Palestinian finance minister sent by Arafat to make peace, admirably captures the conflicting emotions of enduring the pain of exile while seeking to wreak terrible vengeance on the Israeli occupiers. Indeed, for all the quips and light-hearted banter, Oslo is, at heart, a deeply emotional drama. When the Israelis finally strike a deal with the Palestinians during a telephone call to Arafat’s headquarters in Tunis, they think they can hear music playing in the background. In fact it is the battle-hardened veterans of the PLO sobbing at the prospect of being allowed to return to their homeland. Ultimately, the play is an implicit tragedy about the failure of both sides to build a lasting peace on the basis of the painful concessions made during Reproduced by Gorkana under licence from the NLA (newspapers), CLA (magazines), FT (Financial Times/ft.com) or other copyright owner.

On Wed, Feb 15, 2017 at 1:27 AM, Robert Lawrence Kuhn < wrote: Pardon the formality below - I want to approach your very legitimate questions / concerns in a serious manner. Attached and below the same. Dear Jeffrey: As requested, the following addresses your two questions / concerns about our proposed Closer To Truth TV series \"The Science of Sleep and Dreams\": (i) Have there been sufficient breakthroughs in Sleep and Dreams (significantly beyond traditional understandings) to justify a major TV series? (ii) Even if 'yes' to (i), is now the proper time for such a foundational series, or are more years needed for corroborative studies and further research to solidify the breakthroughs? In preparing this response, my primary source is Professor Patrick McNamara, Department of Neurology, Boston University School of Medicine, with whom CTT Producer/Director Peter Getzels and I spoke with at length today. Patrick is one of the leading sleep and dream researchers (he himself more dreams). More importantly, he is perhaps the leading chronicler of the field, with many publications (including 26 entries in related encyclopedias). He is co-editor-in-chief of the \"Encyclopedia of Sleep and Dreams\" (2012) and the sole author of the forthcoming \"An Introduction to the Neuroscience of Sleep and Dreams\" (Cambridge University Press, 2018), which intends to present the latest science and to become a main textbook for graduate courses/seminars. Patrick is a CTT contributor and colleague. When we asked Patrick, his first response — \"This is the ideal time to tell the sleep-and-dreams story\" — and he cited (in essence) your two questions, in that (i) the multiple breakthroughs are now sufficiently well corroborated by numerous independent labs such that a substantial foundation for the new, deeper understanding of sleep and dreams is now for the first time (over the past few years) confirmed and established, and (ii) there are now interesting application and critical clinical questions to pose, explore and pursue, such as for the treatment of various mental-related illnesses that have known sleep-related syndromes (e.g., PTSD and Depression). To understand the significance of recent breakthroughs, a defining characteristic of sleep and dreams is that there are two distinct kinds of sleep — REM (rapid-eye-movement) Sleep and NREM (non-rapid-eye- movement) Sleep. Most dreams are associated with REM sleep (though complex). The eye movement gives the eponymous name, but a more important designation defines the two stages in terms of brain waves (electroencephalograph — EEG): REM is Fast-Wave Sleep (similar to the waking state) and NREM Sleep is Slow-Wave Sleep (very different from the waking state). This difference between REM and NREM sleep has been known since 1953 (different EEGs since 1937), but its deep significance has only been discovered and confirmed in very recent years (as explained below). Following are the key areas of breakthrough in sleep and dreams (from Patrick). Patrick states that these are HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025191 now reproducible, non-controversial, and well-accepted among experts, although still not appreciated by the public - hence the high value of our CTT TV series. The organizing idea is why and how are sleep and dreams essential for normal memory consolidation and bodily health / well-being. Memory Consolidation. There is a fundamental difference between REM and NREM Sleep for memory consolidation: REM is for emotional memories, whereas NREM is for declarative and procedural memories. Hence, understanding and dealing with REM emotional memories can lead to treatment for the many neuropsychiatric illnesses that have sleep/dream-related disorders or syndromes (Parkinson's Disease, Anxiety, Substance Abuse, many sleep disorders such as Nightmare Disorder, etc., in addition to PTSD and Depression). Research shows bi-directional causality between neuropsychiatric disorders and sleep disorders. This is a superb example of how fundamental science breakthroughs lead to clinical breakthroughs. This fact that REM is associated with emotional memories is nicely consistent with the apparent psychotic nature of dreams, because in REM Sleep the frontal cortex is 'down-regulated' (and the frontal cortex is associated with rational planning, reflection, controlling impulses), while in REM Sleep the limbic system is 'up-regulated\" (and the limbic system is associated with emotions and feelings) — see Neuroimaging below. This is why dream states flood the ego with emotional fantasies without rational control. However, it is also true that the limbic system enables creative ideas, thus grounding in science the long-suspected idea that sleep and dreams can enhance creativity. As Dr. Robert Stickgold, our other advisor on the series, wrote: \"It would be nice if we could talk about sleep and memory as if there were only one type of memory and one type of sleep. But this is far from the case. Sleep and memory each comes in many forms, and furthermore, memories can go through multiple forms of post-encoding processing that must be individually addressed.\" Immunity / Immune System. Strengthening the immune system is now a proven product of NREM sleep. Discerning the evolutionary basis for this is a key research project (i.e., it seems counter-intuitive that sleeping facilitates fitness for survival in that predators lurked in the jungles and on the plains so that going unconscious during sleep does not, at first glance, seem especially adaptive). Studies of sleep in various non-human animals reveals a direct relationship between longer periods of NREM (Slow-Wave) Sleep and a stronger immune system, especially in fighting parasites. NREM Sleep releases molecules that fight inflection; NREM Sleep works for the maintenance, repair and activation of the immune system. (This gives scientific rationale for the need or desire to sleep during illnesses.) Related are \"genetic conflict\" studies with respect to REM and NREM, showing differences in heredity between material and paternal lines, and differences between males and females in which genes get \"imprinted\". Neuroplasticity. Exciting recent research has reversed the century-long conventional wisdom that new neurons are never created in adult animals/humans. The development of new neurons — neuronogenesis — is a vital part of maintaining normal brain and mental functioning. New neurons are being created, importantly, in the hippocampus (brain organ where new memories are encoded) — but, remarkably, the neuronogensis in the hippocampus occurs only/largely during REM Sleep — a stunning finding. This is another reason why REM sleep is needed for emotional memory consolidation (normal functioning). Dream-Content. Although dreams have sparked human fascination and fantasy for thousands of years, only in very recent years, have large-scale surveys been conducted with rigorous design, classifications and statistical analysis. Literally hundreds of thousands of dreams are enabling statistically significant theories, including cross-cultural analyses (similarities and differences). Dream-posting sites have revolutionized size and structure of dream data sets. This enables, for the first time, longitudinal studies of dreams over time. Patterns are repeated. For example, in general, the dreams of males and females differ in fundamental ways. Males will engage in fighting with other males; females with both males and females. Male dreamers are often the initiator of fights and the fights are usually physical. Females fight verbally. Aggressiveness by the dreamer is almost always in REM Sleep, rarely in NREM Sleep. (Why is a continuing question.) \"Lucid Dreaming\" is a new area of fascinating research. Lucid Dreaming is where the dreamer \"knows\" that HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025192 he/she is dreaming while dreaming (a talent that a small minority possesses but more can be trained/developed). Lucid dreamers, while sleeping, can now communicate with experimenters by altering their brain activity and thus becoming detectable by neuroimaging techniques (see below). Neuroimaging. Finally, neuroimaging technology has enabled many of these breakthroughs. As such, it is itself a methodological breakthrough that has enabled these other content breakthroughs. Neuroimaging now enables detailed location of the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of REM and NREM Sleep. In REM Sleep, the dorsolateral, frontal cortex is \"down-regulated\", whereas the limbic system is \"up-regulated\", showing the physiological basis for the emotional, wild-fantasies of dreams (see above). (Neuroimaging will enable good visual images for the TV series without extra costs.) Patrick stresses that while these breakthroughs form, for the first time, a solid foundation for understanding sleep and dreams, they also open opportunities to dig deeper into the \"purpose\" of sleep and dreams, as well as engender a new series of questions and directions (e.g., clinical treatments of illnesses). Attached is Patrick's quick compiling of summaries of a few recent leading research papers (2009 — 2017, especially 2015-2017). You'd enjoy speaking with him, if you want.

Arik Sharon was now Minister of Defense, and he came for the final afternoon. From his experience as a frontline commander — in 1956, 1967 and 1973 — he knew the dunes and wadis and sprawling expanses of sand as well as any general in Israel. Watching our intricate mini-war draw to its close, he made no effort to hide his enthusiasm for the kind of quick, assertive battlefield maneuvers he’d long championed. But more than that, his closest aide soon began sounding me out on my views about the long-term organization, force balance and funding for the Israeli military. A few weeks later, Arik offered me a promotion: a return to the kirya, as a two- star general, to become head of planning for the armed forces. I don’t know why he chose me: the Sinai exercise perhaps, the fact he knew I'd studied “large and complex organizations” at Stanford, or maybe just the fact our paths had first crossed two decades earlier when I was in Sayeret Matkal. But even though it meant leaving my division command, especially tough since the final Sinai withdrawal was approaching, it was an offer I never contemplated turning down. Not just because of the second star on my uniform. Ever since the 1973 war, along with a few other senior officers including Dan Shomron, I had been making the case for a shift to more mobile and less vulnerable forces and weapons systems. I saw the new role as a chance to help encourage that critically important change. There was just one hitch: all senior military assignments required the formal approval of the chief-of-staff, my old friend Raful Eitan. Raful did manage to delay things for several weeks. At one point, he even brought to bear a quality I’d never suspected he had: a sense of humor. “OK, Pll agree to promote Barak,” he told Arik. The next day, he said he’d meant /itan Barak — a very good commander, by the way, who had been one of my instructors in officers’ school. Arik insisted, however. My appointment went through. And one, unanticipated result was that I didn’t just play the field command role I’d anticipated, from our Cinerama deployments, in Arik’s toweringly ambitious, ill-planned and ultimately disastrous war in Lebanon. I became part of months of planning discussions in the Airya before our tanks finally rumbled across the northern border on the morning of June 6, 1982. 191 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011662", "metadata": {"source_filename": "IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011662.txt", "parent_doc_id": "IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011662.txt", "chunk_index": 0, "entities": ["I'd", "Cinerama", "Arik The", "Lebanon I", "Minister", "Arik’s", "June", "Airya", "From", "Israel Watching", "Barak,”", "Israeli", "And", "Raful Eitan Raful", "Chapter Twelve My", "Lebanon", "But", "I’d", "Dan Shomron I", "Ever", "Not", "Sinai Arik Sharon", "Stanford", "Pll", "Barak", "Arik", "Defense", "Sinai", "HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011662", "Sayeret Matkal But"]}}], "reference_answer": {"text": "Dan Shomron, I", "structured": null, "metadata": {}}}

Is the money that authoritarians allocate for image beautification well spent? Some campaigns have been more successful than others, but autocracies that hire well-known former cabinet secretaries or elected officials to defend or deny their acts of repression often fail to sway either the public or the policy community in the United States. If democratic leaders have not mounted adequate responses to such repression, it is that the regime in question is benevolent and just. Authoritarian efforts to change governments, as opposed to perceptions, may ultimately prove more rewarding. Russias wager on the rise of friendly European populist parties already seems to be paying off. After Britain's vote to withdraw from the EU and the triumph of Donald Trump in the United States, the prospect of radical shifts in global politics can no longer be dismissed as unthinkable. 1.

We also urge more intense coverage of Beijing's efforts to undermine democratic norms in neighboring states or territories, as in Hong Kong and Taiwan, and its largely successful attempts to pressure other govern- ments into repatriating citizens who had fled persecu- tion in China. Lastly, the media are not doing their job if they neglect to give aggressive coverage to the lobbyists and pub- lic-relations specialists who make money by repre- senting dictators and kleptocrats. Those who flack for the leaders of China, Azerbaijan, Egypt, and their ilk should be made to answer for each political prisoner, murdered opposition figure, shuttered newspaper, and offshore account full of stolen funds that can be tied to their authoritarian clients. To the academic community: We urge academic associations, individual scholars, and university administrations to stand up for freedom of thought and open inquiry at a time when those values are under relentless pressure from dictatorships. We urge statements of protest against the persecution of fellow scholars or the politicized rewriting of history, especially in countries, like Russia and China, that are integrated into the international university system. We urge universities to reject the establishment of projects and study departments—whether at home or overseas—that do not adhere to the highest stan- dards of intellectual freedom or that restrict discus- sion of certain subjects. To the business community: We urge private busi- nesses to avoid commercial relationships with authoritarian governments that force them to violate fundamental democratic principles. Private compa- nies and investors have a clear interest in democratic public goods like the rule of law, which guarantees their property rights, and the transparency provid- ed by free media and corruption watchdogs, which ensures the accuracy of economic data and the fair allocation of state contracts. They should therefore do what they can to prevent any further deterioration in the condition of global democracy. Some sectors are especially vulnerable to authoritarian pressure, and have a special role to play in combating it. We urge the film industry to reject involvement in joint ventures with companies that have close ties to au- thoritarian regimes and reputations for demanding po- liticized censorship of artistic content. We also urge the technology industry to refuse business arrangements that require active complicity in or passive acceptance of political censorship or information control. To the European Union: We urge the EU to undertake a comprehensive review of member states’ democrat- ic institutions to determine whether recent changes have weakened checks and balances or unduly protected incumbent parties from fair electoral com- petition. The EU should adopt measures to publicize departures from democratic standards and develop a new set of sanctions that could be imposed on noncompliant governments—whether inside, outside, or hoping to join the bloc—even in the absence of unanimity among member states. In the meantime, the EU should use the sanctions already in place, even if it means freezing a member state's participation, and be prepared to actually impose any new sanctions that might be introduced. To private foundations: We urge private foundations to recognize and oppose the current assault on democracy. With a few exceptions, the great institu- tions of American philanthropy have studiously—and shamefully—ignored the steady erosion of global free- dom and the rise of authoritarian powers. The recent developments in Europe and the United States will hopefully shake their complacency. There is a strong need for analysis, support for individual dissidents, and aid for societies under authoritarian threat, and as many democratic governments waver in their com- mitment to such priorities, it is essential for private funders to step into the breach. To mainstream political candidates: We urge re- sponsible political figures to call out colleagues or rivals when they show contempt for basic democratic ideas. Until now, politicians in the democracies have been unimpressive in their responses to opponents who embrace authoritarian figures like Putin. This is despite the overwhelming evidence of egregious crimes under Putin’ rule: murdered journalists and political opposition leaders, the invasion of neighbor- ing states, brutish counterinsurgency campaigns in the North Caucasus, the emasculation of a once-vi- brant media sector, rigged elections, and much more. If they choose to shower him with praise, political leaders like Marine Le Pen, Geert Wilders, and Donald Trump should be forced to account for the realities of Putin's appalling record. The same is true for any politi- cian who praises dictators in the Middle East, Asia, or Africa. 60 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019294", "metadata": {"source_filename": "IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019294.txt", "parent_doc_id": "IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019294.txt", "chunk_index": 0, "entities": ["Europe", "Putin’", "China Lastly", "HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019294", "Modern Authoritarians", "Putin This", "Some", "They", "Africa", "Hong Kong", "Russia", "Middle East Asia", "Taiwan", "Until", "European Union We", "United States", "Beijing's", "Marine Le Pen Geert Wilders", "American", "China", "Methods", "With", "North Caucasus", "The EU", "BREAKING DOWN DEMOCRACY Goals Strategies", "Private", "China Azerbaijan Egypt", "Putin's", "Donald Trump"]}}], "reference_answer": {"text": "DOWN DEMOCRACY: Goals, Strategies", "structured": null, "metadata": {}}}

Neither the General Partner nor the Management Company is currently expected to register as an investment adviser with the SEC in reliance on the venture capital fund exemption. The General Partner may need to take into consideration certain conditions regarding the nature of investments that may be made by investment vehicles advised by an investment adviser relying on the venture capital exemption, which may constrain the Fund’s investment flexibility or require certain non-qualifying investments to be disposed of earlier than they might otherwise be. In addition, compliance with the venture capital fund exemption may subject the Fund to limitations on the Fund’s operations, including limitations on the Fund’s ability to borrow, provide guarantees and make short-term investments that are more restrictive than any limitation set forth in the Partnership Agreement. Reliance on the venture capital exemption also will necessitate reporting certain information to the SEC about the Management Company, the General Partner and their affiliates and may result in such entities being subject to SEC examination authority and certain Advisers Act compliance obligations. If the General Partner and the Management Company are able to rely on the venture capital exemption, investors in the Fund will not be entitled to the benefits of certain protections under the Advisers Act. If the General Partner or the Management Company cannot rely on the venture capital exemption, the General Partner or the Management Company may need to register as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Registration under, and compliance with, the Advisers Act could be costly and could divert attention of the Fund’s management team. There also can be no assurance that statutory, regulatory, judicial or administrative interpretations of existing laws and regulations will not in the future impose more comprehensive or stringent requirements on the General Partner or the Management Company.

This means a small teaching load since the best professors teach the least. Three semester-long courses in a year is a light load at a big state university. You might wonder, as an outsider to the ins and outs of the uni- versity, why the best professors teach the least. You also might wonder why I knew the types of courses he would teach and what I mean by that. I will explain. To start this explanation, it is important to understand why pro- fessors are “rewarded” with light teaching loads. (Note the word load. This is the normal way this is discussed in a university.) I was given an extraordinarily light load at Northwestern for two reasons. One reason was that universities, like baseball teams, recruit so-called “su- perstars” (yes, that is how they are referred to in the university) from competitors. So Northwestern had to beat Yale’s offer in my case. At Yale I taught one semester-long course per year, so Northwestern sim- ply made me a better offer. The reason both of these universities would even consider such a light load is that I earned money for the university. As I used to tell my children when they asked “why” questions, in the end it is usually about money. I was recruited by Northwestern (in 1988), but I was really being recruited by Andersen Consulting. They offered Northwestern (that is, they offered me if I came to Northwestern) $30 million (over a 10-year period). Yes, that’s right, $30 million. I think you can see that North- western didn’t really care what I taught or when I taught it. They wanted that money. And, they also wanted the prestige. Before I go too much further, I need to explain the prestige thing because it is very important. In fact, the prestige issue for professors and universities is precisely the root of the problem in our education system. This will take some time to explain, so let me start simply for now. When Harvard plays Yale in football, they are battling for prestige. But the battle may not be on the field exactly. The real battle is in how powerful and important the alumni who attend the game have become and how big their respective endowments have become and who has the best chemistry department or business school. It is a real battle. The battle is for reputation. And, although it may seem silly to take this battle seriously, it is taken very seriously.

Mine, at least, correctly describes those same four years as losing ones. National Accounts Overall It seems to me that national accounts are doing nothing wrong except in modeling the depreciation curve from misleading sales evidence. Evidence seems to show depreciation as fast at first, and slower later. That tends to be true when depreciable assets are actually sold. Structures tend to be customized for their original owners and occupants. They tend to be resold when results are disappointing. This disappointment often comes when expectations are first tested. When distressed sellers market illiquid structures customized for themselves, prices too will be disappointing. Better to trust evidence of structures intended in the first place to pass from owner to owner, as with many standardized rather than customized apartment and office and warehouse buildings. Better still, from an economist’s viewpoint if not an accountant’s, is to trust logic. Capital is present value of expected cash flow. Its loss of value with time, under simplifying assumptions, is the present value of the most distant and most discounted cash flow. Depreciation of structures we keep, rather than sell, is least at first and greatest at the end. It is the same as with a level- payment mortgage. National accounts are nonetheless a magnificent achievement. They need interpretation just as corporate accounts do. That’s where economics comes in. And national accounts are not resting on past practices. They can be congratulated on including market valued capital, even if sixty years too late, and on extrapolating it backward where practical. This book could scarcely have been written if they hadn’t. I would recommend the obvious next step. Net investment should be shown alternatively as change in market-valued, and output as that plus consumption. Let economists decide which version is good for what.

[jeeyacation@gmail.com] Subject: Trump appears with mobster-affiliated felon at New Year's bash/Joe Cinque Importance: High Jeffrey --I thought you might be interested in this article-- Nick Trump appears with mobster-affiliated felon at New Year's bash President-elect Donald Trump rang in the new year together with Joseph \"Joey No Socks\" Cinque — a convicted felon with ties to notorious Gambino crime family boss John Gotti, a recently released video has revealed. Cinque can be seen in a video obtained by the Palm Beach Daily News , cheering loudly as a tuxedo-clad Trump runs through a number of campaign promises before the hundreds of guests attending the New Year's Eve bash the President-elect threw at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Saturday. \"The taxes are coming down, regulations are coming off, we're going to get rid of Obamacare,\" Trump can be heard saying as an exuberant Cinque stands next to him, pumping his fists into the air. Cinque's Sunday appearance with Trump might raise some eyebrows. Beyond a 1989 felony conviction for possessing nearly $100,000 worth of stolen artwork, Cinque \"used to be friends with John Gotti,\" according to a New York Magazine profile from 1995 . Cinque was also \"shot three times and left for dead\" in a 1980 incident that authorities described as \"a hit,\" according to the profile. Further, Saturday's Mar-a-Lago party was far from the first time Cinque cheered on for Trump. An Associated Press report from this spring showed that the American Academy of Hospitality Sciences, a company owned and operated by Cinque, has awarded more than a dozen of Trump's golf courses, hotels, casinos and private clubs with so-called \"Star Diamond\" awards \"of true excellence in hospitality.\" The same report also found that about half of the roughly 30 people listed as \"trustees\" to the company are Trump friends or business associates. Trump, meanwhile, was listed on the company's website as its \"ambassador extraordinaire,\" and he even appeared in a 2009 tribute video to Cinque in which he said, \"There's nobody like him. He's a special guy.\" But when asked by reporters about Cinque in May, Trump denied knowing anything about him or his criminal past. \"If a guy's going to give you an award, you take it,\" the President-elect said at the time. \"You don't tend to look up his whole life story.\" The Trump transition team did not immediately return a request for comment on how the President-elect knows Cinque or why they appeared together Saturday. While standing alongside Cinque, Trump also took a moment to address the terror attack that left scores of nightclub revelers in Istanbul dead over the weekend — and how the bloodbath somehow necessitates a Mexican border wall. \"We will build a wall, you know that. We will build a wall,\" the President-elect told the raucous crowd. HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033210 \"And speaking of walls,\" he continued. \"In Turkey tonight — has anybody heard? Big disaster took place in Turkey tonight. Many, many, many people killed...It's a horror show. So we're going to get things running properly.\" ISIS claimed responsibility for the Saturday attack , which left at least 39 people dead and dozens more wounded, calling the lone gunman who carried out the massacre a \"heroic soldier of the caliphate.\" The suspect had yet to be named and located by Turkish authorities early Tuesday. The President-elect made building a wall along the country's southern border one of his main campaign talking points, frequently promising his supporters that it will be a \"great\" and \"beautiful\" wall. But his pledge to construct a border barrier has gone under several renditions, with the President-elect admitting in November that it might actually end up \"part wall, part fence.\" HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033211", "metadata": {"source_filename": "TEXT-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_033210.txt", "parent_doc_id": "TEXT-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_033210.txt", "chunk_index": 0, "entities": ["New York Magazine", "Nick Trump", "He's", "There's", "Cinque Trump", "Tuesday The President-elect", "Cinque", "Cinque Importance High Jeffrey", "Saturday The", "You", "Subject Trump", "President-elect", "New Year's", "Turkey", "Palm Beach Daily News", "Big", "Turkish", "Trump An Associated Press", "Hospitality Sciences", "And", "Star Diamond", "Saturday While", "Mar-a-Lago", "Further Saturday's Mar-a-Lago", "Joseph Joey No Socks Cinque", "American Academy", "November", "Cinque's Sunday", "ISIS", "Obamacare Trump", "Beyond", "But", "President-elect Donald Trump", "The Trump", "New Year's Eve", "Mexican", "HOUSE OVERSIGHT", "Many", "May Trump", "Trump", "From Nicholas Ribis____________________________________________ Sent", "Saturday", "Trump's", "John Gotti", "Gambino", "Istanbul", "Florida"]}}], "reference_answer": {"text": "Nicholas Ribis____________________________________________ Sent", "structured": null, "metadata": {}}}

The result is an equipartition of phase space such that there is at most one orbital point in each rectangle of the grid, with, of course, many rectangles in the finer grids being empty. This final grid partition is called a generating partition. The proportion of the available boxes of the partition occupied by points is called its area or volume measure. This measure has been given a variety of names including Liouville, Haar and Lesbegue measures. lf every box is occupied, it has measure one. If at most one box, it has measure zero. If we allow partitions to be non-uniform and/or not fine enough to be generating and apply probability weightings for how many points fall into each particular box of the grid, the method is called the Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen or SRB measure after Kolmogorov’s students and followers, the Russian, Ya Sinai, the Belgian Frenchmen, David Ruelle and the American, Rufus Bowen. Similar to the SRB measure, the distribution of box occupancy probabilities multiplied by their logarithms and summed over all cells of the partition yields a statistical measure that is close to the informational entropy of Claude Shannon as described above. It is called the metric entropy ( Hy = -X(p; In(pi)), where H means entropy and gj; is the proportion of the total observations that occupy cell i of the phase space or state space partition. It was the above noted Russian father of modern dynamical systems, Kolmogorov, who in 1956 proved that the Shannon metric entropy is a quantifiable invariant of systems even in very complicated motion. Stanford University's Donald Ornstein won a Field’s Medal (the under forty year old mathematician’s Nobel Prize) for his late 1960’s work proving that the Shannon metric entropy, Hy, was the only invariant for a large class of appropriately defined, expansive (near by points separating in time) dynamical systems. Recall that we refer to metric entropy reflecting the relative occupancy as probability among the possible boxes (or states) as Hy. Hy is maximal when the percentage occupancy of all occupied boxes is uniform.

Iam currently on a plane. I sent you earlier from the plane an email response to your letter, which IT hope you received. Regarding your note below: My earlier remark to you was based on my correspondence with the universities during and after the investigation, and the conclusion I drew from the ANU report, which I quoted for you in my response to your note. The claims made in the allegation which were later demonstrated to be false, or which were then not supported after repeated requests from the University to substantiate the claim, provided evidence that the claim was fabricated (as I knew it must be), and therefore maliciously so. I had been planning on resigning my honorary appointment at ANU before I received the original letter from ANU because my wife had moved to the US several years ago, and I no longer visited the University regularly to work with colleagues there as I did in earlier years. When I received the letter from ANU regarding the complaint, I decided to wait to resign my appointment until the investigation was completed and the complaint was dismissed. After it was, I sent my note of resignation in, and I note that upon its receipt the Dean he suggested I remain on until my appointment expired at the end of this year, but as I had made my decision to resign earlier I felt no need to wait until then. I received a very nice note from the director of the unit I work with (who was made aware of the complaint and its resolution by the Dean) who expressed thanks for my many contributions to the University while there, and my interactions with staff, students, and faculty there. I hope this clarifies your issues. LMK On Dec 11, 2017, at 9:02 AM, Peter Aldhous ( wrote: Dr. Krauss, Since sending the note below, we have heard from the Australian National University. They informed us: \"The characterisation by Professor Krauss that The Australian National University (ANU) found the complaint to be ‘unsubstantiated and fabricated with malicious intent’ is false.\" They also told us that you resigned your honorary appointment at ANU on November 3. Can you comment on the reason for your resignation from ANU? I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this with you. Again, we are planning on publishing our story Tuesday morning, Eastern US Time.

An extraordinary assumption is uncertain information accepted as fact. If the assumption is found to be false as of the effective date of the appraisal, we reserve the right to modify our value conclusions. 1. The subject property has a fueling dock and four fuel storage tanks located on site; including three diesel and one gasoline. There were no signs of contamination during our inspection and we have assumed that there is no adverse environmental impact in connection with the existing fuel equipment used on the subject property. 2. The parking garage at the subject slightly encroaches on the neighboring property to the immediate northwest. This land is owned by the Government of the Virgin Islands and we have assumed that no claim will arise from the encroachments. 3. For this analysis, we have valued the going concern interest in the subject property and have allocated the value of the personal property from the value of the real property. We were provided with financial statments from ownership that indicates the depreciated book value of these assets. Itis beyond our scope to value these assets in use; therefore, we have assumed that the book values of teh personal property items shown in the statments provided by ownership are reasonably accurate for the purpose of this allocation exercise. The value conclusions are based on the following hypothetical conditions that may affect the assignment results. A hypothetical condition is a condition contrary to known fact on the effective date of the appraisal but is supposed for the purpose of analysis. 1. No hypothetical conditions were employed in this analysis. The opinions of value expressed in this report are based on estimates and forecasts that are prospective in nature and subject to considerable risk and uncertainty. Events may occur that could cause the performance of the property to differ materially from our estimates, such as changes in the economy, interest rates, capitalization rates, financial strength of tenants, and behavior of investors, lenders, and consumers. Additionally, our opinions and forecasts are based partly on data obtained from interviews and third party sources, which are not always completely reliable. Although we are of the opinion that our findings are reasonable based on available evidence, we are not responsible for the effects of future occurrences that cannot reasonably be foreseen at this time. ire.

For the second year, nearly 6,000 Academy members have nominated 10 films and the battle seems to be pared down to 2. The beloved instant classic, The King’s Speech, marches into the arena as the frontrunner, but passionate supporters of the edgier (critics’ darling) The Social Network have not conceded. The ballots are counted, the party invites are out and still the feelings are raw. Nominees are exhausted from campaigning. Woody Allen and George Lucas tell me they are no longer members of the Academy because pitting artists against each other to determine the quality of their work is insane. They are right. My event and publicity company is considered Switzerland by the studios, as we help every filmmaker to present his work. However, this year, against my better judgment, I am somewhat emotionally sucked in. In 2005, I met the unknown 32-year-old English director Tom Hooper on his first film for HBO, Elizabeth I starring Helen Mirren. Helen later wins an Oscar for portraying Queen Elizabeth in The Queen. Queen Elizabeth is the daughter of King George VI, portrayed by Oscar-winner Colin Firth in The King’s Speech directed by Hooper. No degrees of separation. At the Telluride Film Festival, Tom Hooper bathed in the glory of a hysterical standing ovation alongside Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush at the very first public screening of that film. Two weeks later at The Toronto Film Festival, Harvey Weinstein stood with his filmmakers witnessing the same reaction. The film won The Audience Prize. Their strategy was to say nothing, do nothing. They have a possible Oscar winner—four out of five past Best Pictures have premiered in Toronto. Cut to New York City at the end of September. It’s opening night at The Film Society of Lincoln Center. One of America’s most important and prolific producers, Scott Rudin, along with Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Aaron Sorkin, are in a brightly lit box waving down to their equally hysterical audience who have just seen The Social Network. The film opens the next day to rave reviews and endless publicity. David Fincher is off making The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Aaron Sorkin becomes the face of the film and an immediate shoo-in for the adapted screenplay Oscar. The Hamptons International Film Festival in October suddenly becomes a launching pad for 127 Hours, where star-cum-Yale/NYU student James Franco appears. More Oscar buzz. Producer/director Danny Boyle (Oscar winner for Slumdog Millionaire) stays in London all fall directing the play Frankenstein. Black Swan also unspools there in a tiny theater as Madonna, Alec Baldwin and Harvey Weinstein slip in the back. Darren Aronofsky is hailed a genius. Natalie Portman is instantly the hot nominee for Best Actress. Both films are sensations, but it’s The King’s Speech that wins The Audience Prize. Mid-November: David O. Russell and Mark Wahlberg sneak The Fighter in Manhattan. As their audience erupts in cheers, I tell producer/actor Wahlberg, “Clint Eastwood is going to kill himself for not directing this.” He says, “You’re wrong. He turned it down because he’s done it. He’s seen it and he loves it.” David O. Russell becomes my new Clint Eastwood. Christian Bale and Melissa Leo are hailed the supporting actors to beat. True Grit, directed by the Coen Brothers and also produced by Scott Rudin, finally throws its cowboy hat in the ring in mid-December at the Ziegfeld as the last serious Oscar contender for Best Picture. It gallops off to box office gold. The Social Network now cements its battle cry with one word: relevance. Mark Zuckerberg lands on the cover of Time Magazine as “Person of the Year.” A smart and extensive ad campaign positions the film in the lead. Critics and pundits proclaim the race is over. Everyone goes on holiday. This is one of the few times in Harvey Weinstein’s life that he’s caught off guard. He quickly mobilizes an inner team of 15 and conducts strategy meetings 7 days a week, including Christmas. They’re like a Chinese restaurant: always open. He sends screenwriter David Seidler and Tom Hooper to every corner of the country doing Q&As until they are both blue in the face from “finding their voice.” SAG voters begin seeing the film two and three times. In January at the Golden Globes, about 88 foreign journalists give awards to The Social Network for Best Drama, Director and Screenplay. The film is still perceived as the Oscar winner and nobody can stop the steamroller. Only Academy voters disregard these awards. The King’s Speech wins the PGA in L.A. Everyone is totally surprised when Tom Hooper goes on to win the DGA. After a tremendous amount of hard work by team Weinstein, the actors win for the SAG Ensemble. The BAFTAs reinforced their lead; the film is now the frontrunner. It takes the media a few weeks to catch on. Emma Stone Collin Firth and Anne Hathaway Gwyneth Paltrow Sandra Bullock Tom Hooper Carolina Herrera Jennifer Lawrence Marisa Tomei Leslie Mann and Judd Apatow Melissa Leo Steve Martin Steven Tyler and Liv Tyler George Hamilton and Kimberly Blackford Kevin Spacey L’Wren Scott and Mick Jagger I whisper to Harrison [Ford], “That looks just like Johnny Depp.” Harrison rolls his eyes and reluctantly introduces me to his friend . . . Johnny Depp. The Daily Mail announces Her Royal Highness Queen Elizabeth has enjoyed a private screening of The King’s Speech and is “moved” by the film. With no proof the Queen has actually seen the film, press agents send out a global press release thanking her Majesty for the endorsement. FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 24 Mid-day, I arrive at The Beverly Hills Hotel. As the housekeepers unpack my bags upstairs I peek into the Polo Lounge and find Warren Beatty in a booth. I tell him I’m rooting for his wife, Annette Benning, and love her film, The Kids Are All Right. Warren says The Social Network will win. This year I am two days late arriving to Oscar weekend. I am shown to a very, very small room—the size of a broom closet. Uncharacteristically, I have a slight melt down. I am moved. The housekeepers run down the hall with my clothes flying. The hotel is sold out, so I get someone else’s room. Another unsuspecting victim checking in downstairs will get the broom closet. It is cold, grey and rainy. Taffeta, organdy and embroidered silk evening clothes hang in my closet. I stay in my sweaters and fur coat, and head to Arianna Huffington’s home in Beverly Hills where she and Wendi Murdoch are hosting a party for Tom Freston’s wife, the beautiful, blonde Kathy. Her book is called Veganist: Lose Weight, Get Healthy, Change the World—perfect for monks. Arianna has just sold the Huffington Post to AOL for $315 million dollars and is rumored to have personally landed around $20 million. She is euphoric as she greets Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban at the door. Other drenched power players include Disney’s Bob Iger and wife Willow Bay,Fox’s Jim Gianopulos, Candice Bergen and journalist daughter Chloe Malle, Google’s Eric Schmidt, Oliver Stone escorting his daughter Tara and avoiding questions about Charlie Sheen, Moby, Jamie Niven, Brian Grazer, Vivi Nevo, CBS’s Les Moonves and Julie Chen, Rob Reiner, Paramount’s Brad Grey and fiancé Cassandra Huysentruyt and Jeff Bezos. Hors d’oeuvres include pigs in blankets—a food group not mentioned in Kathy’s book. The action migrates to UTA Jim Burkus’ home for a party for True Grit’s Ethan and Joel Coen. I pass Ron Howard on the way in and he says, “Keep me on your list.” Is he kidding? Sunrise and Mark Ruffalo, Focus Feature’s James Shamus, Nancy Meyers and John Goldwyn mingle. Adorable Hallie Steinfeld is there with her parents. I am trying to fix her up with Justin Bieber. She giggles, “Peg, I am only 14.” I am face to face with Harrison Ford and stupidly tell him I love him in Morning Glory. He’s looking at me in utter disbelief, but I will not shut up. A gorgeous guy is inches away in a hat and glasses. I whisper to Harrison, “That looks just like Johnny Depp.” Harrison rolls his eyes and reluctantly introduces me to his friend . . . Johnny Depp. I babble a bit about his great work then run for cover in a corner next to my buddy, Jerry Bruckheimer. I head over to the CAA/Bryan Lourd’s “Friday Night Party.” Torrential rains and horrific winds cause a traffic jam that makes it impossible to get near the house. The world’s most famous faces cower under black umbrellas and make a run for it. Bryan Lourd and Bruce Bozzi receive friends at the door all night. Inside, Uma Thurman tells me she finally moved into a doorman building in New York after being terrorized by stalkers for years. Ben Walker talks about Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, which he is about to shoot, while his fiancé, Mamie Gummer, looks sexy shivering in a white satin gown. Producer Jon Kilik mentions he oversaw a new cut of Julian Schnabel’s Miral, to be released in March. Bennett Miller, standing with Kristin Gore, says Sony loves his new film, Moneyball, and Brad Pitt is terrific. (When is Brad Pitt not terrific?) Sandy Gallin tells me he has an actual job decorating Jeffrey Katzenberg’s home. I congratulate Barry Levinson’s son Sam, a director, for winning the writing award at Sundance for his first film, Another Happy Day. Also seen floating around are Taylor Swift and Jake Gyllenhaal—but not together—Sean Penn, Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, Anderson Cooper, Hilary Swank, Kelly Ripa, Paul Haggis, Marisa Tomei, Kate Beckinsale, Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher, Kate Hudson, Gerard Butler, Renee Zellweger with Bradley Cooper, Biutiful director Alejandro Gonzalez-Inarritu, Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal, Ellen Barkin (who is headed to Broadway in The Normal Heart this spring) and CAA’s Kevin Huvane, Richard Lovett and Hylda Queally. Sony Classic’s Michael Barker tells me The Social Network will win. Tired celebs try to go home, but limo lock is at a standstill. Cell phones don’t work in the area. Two hundred swells become party prisoners and happily hang out till 5 a.m. SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 26 Out comes the sun and dries up all the rain. IAC chairmen and owner of Newsweek/The Daily Beast Barry Diller and his wife Diane Von Furstenberg (with her kids Alex and Tatiana) host their 15th annual lunch for Graydon Carter in their Coldwater Canyon home. Barry introduces me to his star guest, Gov. Jerry Brown, just elected to his third (nonconsecutive) term as California governor. Like last year, enormous clear plastic tents are erected on the hill near the house. Long wooden picnic tables sit on oriental rugs covering the soggy ground. VIPs wears winter clothes, comfy sweaters and sensible shoes. I arrive in a fur coat. Stephen Gaghan and Minnie Mortimer Scarlett Johansson Charlize Theron Lourdes Leon and Madonna Armie Hammer Kate Beckinsale Aaron Sorkin Georgina Chapman Hilary Swank Cameron Diaz Wendi Murdoch, Kathy Freston and Arianna Huffington Natalie Portman Brian Grazer and Jeff Bezos Tom Ford Everybody knows everybody, and it doesn’t matter if you have a hit film or T.V. show this season. Oprah Winfrey kisses David Geffen, casually chats with former Disney C.E.O. Michael Eisner and current Sony Chief Sir Howard Stringer and Rob Weisenthal. Brett Ratner arrives with his houseguest Jean Pigozzi, who is allowed to take photographs. Graydon greets people with chic wife Anna by his side. Ingrid Sischy and Sandy Brant, Rupert Murdoch, Ron Meyer, Francesco Clemente with his twin boys and Tom Ford chat each other up. People to watch include pregnant Victoria and David Beckham with Lynn Wyatt, Fran Lebowitz, Larry Gagosian and Shala Monroque, Ben Silverman, Debbie and Allen I head over to the CAA/Bryan Lourd’s “Friday Night Party.” Torrential rains and horrific winds cause a traffic jam that makes it impossible to get near the house. The world’s most famous faces cower under black umbrellas and make a run for it. Grubman, Sotheby’s Tobias Meyer and Mark Fletcher and Stephen Gaghan and Mini Mortimer wearing her oversized cat glasses. Bruce Cohen has invited me to the Oscar broadcast rehearsal. Inside the Kodak Theater’s massive auditorium, I find a seat next to his proud parents. I watch Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem come out in white dinner jackets and flub their lines as they pretend to present Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Original Screenplay. Josh will later tell me that their acting methods are completely opposite: he’s a quick study and is very creative and comfortable ad-libbing; Javier, whose mother tongue is Spanish, likes to have every syllable printed out to study with a dialect coach. Life-size photos on cardboard plaques are taped to each nominee’s chair. I memorize their location so when I return Sunday I can quickly kiss them all. Back at the Beverly Hills hotel I slip into my black tulle Dennis Basso cocktail dress with a plunging neckline and put on my mother’s jewels. Jim Coleman takes me to the “Night Before Party” in the hotel. This is Jeffrey Katzenberg’s 9th annual A-lister event benefiting The Motion Picture & Television Fund where they raise $6.5 million dollars in 1 night. I walk into Valentino, who gives me an approving once-over. I tell him and Giancarlo Giammetti that Woody Allen’s new film, Midnight in Paris, is opening the Cannes Film Festival and they must bring the yacht. Elton John and David Furnish join our conversation so of course we ask for intimate details about baby Zachary. I segue over to Amy Adams, who, like them, mentions she hates leaving her baby in the hotel room. Next stop is Kate Capshaw in a black bowler hat chatting with Steven Spielberg’s god-daughter, Gwyneth Paltrow. I have known Steven for years (in 1982 I was a publicist on E.T.). I now tell him I’m going to the Lincoln Center opening of War Horse with Kathy Kennedy and Frank Marshall and cannot wait to see his movie version. I meet sweet Jennifer Aniston, her new haircut and her perfect little body. Her date tells me her secret is a half-hour on the treadmill everyday—such an understatement. I tell Jesse Eisenberg I was on his plane home from the Baftas last week, but he was hiding under his hoodie. He says innocently, “You should have said ‘hello.’ I always cover my head because I think my curls make me look like a girl.” The charity gives us a coupon booklet redeemable at various booths. Rich people run around like lunatics, collecting gifts for their housekeepers. Among the shoppers are Steven and Heather Mnuchin, Viacom’s Deborah and Philippe Dauman, Tamara Mellon, Christine Taylor and Ben Stiller, Cate Blanchet, Susan and Robert Downey Jr. and Debra and Hugh Jackman. Next stop is The Weinstein Company’s party at the Soho House sponsored by MontBlanc. Long gone are the funky Miramax Saturday night soirees where nominees spoofed their own films in homemade costumes and ad-libbed hilarious skits. No more grown men dressed as Anna Paquin playing the piano in hopes of winning a Max Award. As I come in, a 400-pound gorilla refuses to let me on the elevator. Once on, I see Jennifer Lopez in the corner and remind her we met on Len Blavatnik’s yacht in Cannes. She graciously pretends to remember me. Her manager, Benny Medina, is kicking me. I slip into Colin Firth’s booth to have a tête-à-tête with him and his wife Livia Giuggioli. Jokingly, I suggest he say “I’m speechless” when he wins. Colin patiently assures me many people, far more clever than I, thought of this. He then says that others are waging bets on whether he might subconsciously stutter. I grill him about his wardrobe, assuming he will be wearing a new Tom Ford tuxedo. He tells me both he and Ford will be in older Ford models. I tell him I made rich-butthrifty Charles Ferguson, director of Inside Job, spend $6,000 dollars for a new Tom Ford tux. In the back room, Jennifer Lopez is now seated with Weinstein’s wife, Georgina Chapman. Helena Bonham Carter, her live-in-lover Tim Burton and her mother Elena circulate. Star power includes Adrien Brody, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Cameron Diaz, Camilla Belle, Chace Vera Farmiga Adrien Brody Andrew Garfield Oliver Stone and Tara Stone Claire Danes and Hugh Dancy Hailee Steinfeld Taylor Swift Donald and Melania Trump Donna Karan Lynn Wyatt Barry Diller Jon Hamm and Jennifer Westfeldt Anderson Cooper Chloe Malle and Candice Bergen Diane von Furstenberg Tory Burch Crawford, Claire Danes and Hugh Dancy, Darren Aronofsky, director John Wells, Kerry Washington, Piers Morgan, Rachel Zoe, Sean Parker, Zack Braff and Leonardo Dicaprio with Bar Rafaeli. Speech filmmakers are functioning on high anxiety. SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 27 Producer Donna Gigliotti is my date to the awards. We are both so nervous we arrive at the Kodak Theater at 3 p.m. and nobody is there. We are driven around for an hour. When we arrive back at the world’s most famous red carpet, I guide Donna through security check-in to the extreme right to make sure we get on camera. I teach her the red carpet hustle, which is five steps forward, three steps back, one inch behind a couture-clad nominee. We greet Kevin Huvane as Sandra Bullock is talking to ABC-TV and a billion people see me wearing a black Marchesa gown. Five steps forward, three steps back, we next meet Gwyneth Paltrow, and I hook up the back of her dress while another billion people see me correct the fashion malfunction. Five steps forward, three steps back, we’re now posing behind Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban. Our Blackberrys begin buzzing; the world has seen us. James Franco and Anne Hathaway are hip hosts. This is the year of no surprises. But it isn’t until Hilary Swank yells out Hooper’s name for Best Director that Harvey’s gang finally realizes they are getting the Oscar for Best Picture after all. Harvey is sitting in Spielberg’s seat as Spielberg announces the win from the stage. Producers Iain Canning, Emile Sherman and Gareth Unwin leap up and kiss each other.Six months of grueling work have finally paid off. King George VI and Harvey Weinstein now share the journey of a single man who triumphs over adversity. At the Governor’s ball, held above the Kodak Theater, the winners triumphantly sachet around the room holding their heavy eight-pound gold statues. An hour later there is a migration to the Vanity Fair party hosted by Graydon Carter at Jeff Klein’s Sunset Tower Hotel. The invitation features a gold hologram that transmits a radio frequency of a photo and details about the guest to VF staff as they arrive. The next day “Page Six” will report that the backup private security firm is run by a former Israeli operative, when in fact they are Irish Catholics from Staten Island. There’s a hierarchy of arrival times. At 5 p.m. the inner circle of Graydon’s 141 best friends attend a seated dinner. They include Barry Diller and Diane von Furstenberg, Francis Ford Coppola, Jon Hamm and Jennifer Westfeldt, Betsey Bloomingdale, Tory Burch and Lyor Cohen, Carolina and Reinaldo Herrera, L’Wren Scott and Sir Mick Jagger, Naomi Watts and Liev Schreiber, Wendi Stark, George Hamilton, Judd Apatow, Jackie and Joan Collins, Donna Karan and Steve Martin. The best and the brightest talent in town arrive at 9 p.m. Every single winner shows up. Also there are Justin Bieber and his date Selena Gomez, Michelle Williams, Emma Stone, Steve Tyler and Liv Tyler, Andrew Garfield, Jude Law, Armie Hammer, Vera Farmiga, Kevin Spacey, Charlize Theron, Anne Hathaway, Winter’s Bone star-of-tomorrow Jennifer Lawrence, Taylor Hackford and Helen Mirren, Scarlett Johansson, Isla Fischer and Sasha Baron Cohen, Tom Hanks, Sean Penn, Renee Zellweger and Bradley Cooper and Jane Fonda after her play, 33 Variations. I introduce Melania and Donald Trump to David O. Russell as The Trumpster gushes about The Fighter. David tells Donald he used to be a waiter/bar tender at many of Trump’s parties. Donald smiles as if looking at yet another apprentice. He then offers me a ride home on his plane; he’s leaving in 10 minutes. Too bad James Franco didn’t know because he is presently sitting on a commercial flight back to school, skipping his own after-party. The rest of the guests’ social standings are determined by half-hour increments. VF’s Beth Kseniak, Matt Ullian and Jane Sarkin tell me the list is cut down to 800 this year. At 11:30 p.m. there is another celebrity migration up the hill to Madonna manager Guy Oseary’s house. Earlier in the I introduce Melania and Donald Trump to David O. Russell . . . David tells Donald he used to be a waiter/bar tender at many of Trump’s parties. Donald smiles as if looking at yet another apprentice. evening, Madonna came down the hill to pose in a risqué see-thru outfit with daughter Lourdes. Madonna and co-host Demi Moore are able to lure the crème de la crème with the promise of dancing and no cameras. MONDAY, FEBRUARY 28 A winner’s work is never done. Colin Firth, Tom Hooper and David Seidler show up at 4:30 a.m. at The Four Seasons Hotel for a live broadcast on “The Today Show.” Functioning on an adrenalin rush, they return to the Kodak Theater with Geoffrey Rush to appear on Oprah’s live broadcast. By the end of this year’s thrilling race between two great producers—Scott Rudin and Harvey Weinstein— Facebook and Twitter are credited for aiding political justice from the streets of Cairo to Tripoli. But the British film with the most heart wins as one single human voice can still make a difference. The king has spoken. ✦ Fran Lebowitz Julie Chen Ellen Barkin Naomi Watts Joan Collins Chace Crawford", "metadata": {"source_filename": "TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012700.txt", "parent_doc_id":

The teachers could introduce whatever aspects of physics they wanted to help students understand the predictive process in that area, but other faculty who did predic- tion in other areas would be part of the discussion. There would be a set of interesting issues ranging from predictions that were thought to be right but weren't, to predictions that are being made today in each area. The content would be the predictive process itself, not the traditional subject matter. Statistics (and other useful tools) would be taught in this context while the predictive process was being studied. Modeling. Who build models? Psychologists think about models of the mind, as do computer scientists and philosophers who specialize in thinking about thinking. Architects and economists build models of a different sort. Engineers work with models regularly. All of these people use different modeling tools but they work on the same thing: trying to figure out how something works by building it and seeing if they can replicate it. They may be using a computer or building blocks or electricity or art. It makes no difference. It is all an attempt to see how things work by building some facsimile. This is an important idea in human thinking, and a course should be taught to undergraduates on how to do it by the people who actually do it, teaching different techniques as they go. They are many ways to build a model, and students in college should know the possibilities before they take on further study. Experimentation. Psychologists do experiments. Chemists do experiments. Physicists do experiments. Medical researchers do experiments. (The drug companies are constantly doing experiments that affect us all.) Why is there no course in learning how to do an experiment? Shouldn't students be learning how to come up with a hypothesis and how to test that hypothesis? Isn’t that more important as a fundamental building block of the mind than any course offered to freshmen in college today? Evaluation. Every academic field does evaluation. In every discipline there are ways and means to discuss and evaluate the worth of papers and research and practical proposals.

Neither the General Partner nor the Management Company is currently expected to register as an investment adviser with the SEC in reliance on the venture capital fund exemption. The General Partner may need to take into consideration certain conditions regarding the nature of investments that may be made by investment vehicles advised by an investment adviser relying on the venture capital exemption, which may constrain the Fund’s investment flexibility or require certain non-qualifying investments to be disposed of earlier than they might otherwise be. In addition, compliance with the venture capital fund exemption may subject the Fund to limitations on the Fund’s operations, including limitations on the Fund’s ability to borrow, provide guarantees and make short-term investments that are more restrictive than any limitation set forth in the Partnership Agreement. Reliance on the venture capital exemption also will necessitate reporting certain information to the SEC about the Management Company, the General Partner and their affiliates and may result in such entities being subject to SEC examination authority and certain Advisers Act compliance obligations. If the General Partner and the Management Company are able to rely on the venture capital exemption, investors in the Fund will not be entitled to the benefits of certain protections under the Advisers Act. If the General Partner or the Management Company cannot rely on the venture capital exemption, the General Partner or the Management Company may need to register as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Registration under, and compliance with, the Advisers Act could be costly and could divert attention of the Fund’s management team. There also can be no assurance that statutory, regulatory, judicial or administrative interpretations of existing laws and regulations will not in the future impose more comprehensive or stringent requirements on the General Partner or the Management Company.

Petitioners do not contend that Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4’s “participation in this case” can only be achieved by listing them as parties. As it stands under the original petition, the merits of this case will be decided based on a determination of whether the Government violated the rights of Jane Doe 1, Jane Doe 2, and all “other similarly situated victims” under the CVRA. Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 may offer relevant, admissible, and non-cumulative evidence that advances that determination, but their participation as listed parties is not necessary in that regard.

These are not the topsecret opening lines of Aaron Sorkin’s new script, but the global headlines of a world spinning out of control as I head to Los Angeles like an overdressed lemming to attend the 83rd Academy Awards and attempt to make sense of artists thrust into combat. For the second year, nearly 6,000 Academy members have nominated 10 films and the battle seems to be pared down to 2. The beloved instant classic, The King’s Speech, marches into the arena as the frontrunner, but passionate supporters of the edgier (critics’ darling) The Social Network have not conceded. The ballots are counted, the party invites are out and still the feelings are raw. Nominees are exhausted from campaigning. Woody Allen and George Lucas tell me they are no longer members of the Academy because pitting artists against each other to determine the quality of their work is insane. They are right. My event and publicity company is considered Switzerland by the studios, as we help every filmmaker to present his work. However, this year, against my better judgment, I am somewhat emotionally sucked in. In 2005, I met the unknown 32-year-old English director Tom Hooper on his first film for HBO, Elizabeth I starring Helen Mirren. Helen later wins an Oscar for portraying Queen Elizabeth in The Queen. Queen Elizabeth is the daughter of King George VI, portrayed by Oscar-winner Colin Firth in The King’s Speech directed by Hooper. No degrees of separation. At the Telluride Film Festival, Tom Hooper bathed in the glory of a hysterical standing ovation alongside Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush at the very first public screening of that film. Two weeks later at The Toronto Film Festival, Harvey Weinstein stood with his filmmakers witnessing the same reaction. The film won The Audience Prize. Their strategy was to say nothing, do nothing. They have a possible Oscar winner—four out of five past Best Pictures have premiered in Toronto. Cut to New York City at the end of September. It’s opening night at The Film Society of Lincoln Center. One of America’s most important and prolific producers, Scott Rudin, along with Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Aaron Sorkin, are in a brightly lit box waving down to their equally hysterical audience who have just seen The Social Network. The film opens the next day to rave reviews and endless publicity. David Fincher is off making The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Aaron Sorkin becomes the face of the film and an immediate shoo-in for the adapted screenplay Oscar. The Hamptons International Film Festival in October suddenly becomes a launching pad for 127 Hours, where star-cum-Yale/NYU student James Franco appears. More Oscar buzz. Producer/director Danny Boyle (Oscar winner for Slumdog Millionaire) stays in London all fall directing the play Frankenstein. Black Swan also unspools there in a tiny theater as Madonna, Alec Baldwin and Harvey Weinstein slip in the back. Darren Aronofsky is hailed a genius. Natalie Portman is instantly the hot nominee for Best Actress. Both films are sensations, but it’s The King’s Speech that wins The Audience Prize. Mid-November: David O. Russell and Mark Wahlberg sneak The Fighter in Manhattan. As their audience erupts in cheers, I tell producer/actor Wahlberg, “Clint Eastwood is going to kill himself for not directing this.” He says, “You’re wrong. He turned it down because he’s done it. He’s seen it and he loves it.” David O. Russell becomes my new Clint Eastwood. Christian Bale and Melissa Leo are hailed the supporting actors to beat. True Grit, directed by the Coen Brothers and also produced by Scott Rudin, finally throws its cowboy hat in the ring in mid-December at the Ziegfeld as the last serious Oscar contender for Best Picture. It gallops off to box office gold. The Social Network now cements its battle cry with one word: relevance. Mark Zuckerberg lands on the cover of Time Magazine as “Person of the Year.” A smart and extensive ad campaign positions the film in the lead. Critics and pundits proclaim the race is over. Everyone goes on holiday. This is one of the few times in Harvey Weinstein’s life that he’s caught off guard. He quickly mobilizes an inner team of 15 and conducts strategy meetings 7 days a week, including Christmas. They’re like a Chinese restaurant: always open. He sends screenwriter David Seidler and Tom Hooper to every corner of the country doing Q&As until they are both blue in the face from “finding their voice.” SAG voters begin seeing the film two and three times. In January at the Golden Globes, about 88 foreign journalists give awards to The Social Network for Best Drama, Director and Screenplay. The film is still perceived as the Oscar winner and nobody can stop the steamroller. Only Academy voters disregard these awards. The King’s Speech wins the PGA in L.A. Everyone is totally surprised when Tom Hooper goes on to win the DGA. After a tremendous amount of hard work by team Weinstein, the actors win for the SAG Ensemble. The BAFTAs reinforced their lead; the film is now the frontrunner. It takes the media a few weeks to catch on. Emma Stone Collin Firth and Anne Hathaway Gwyneth Paltrow Sandra Bullock Tom Hooper Carolina Herrera Jennifer Lawrence Marisa Tomei Leslie Mann and Judd Apatow Melissa Leo Steve Martin Steven Tyler and Liv Tyler George Hamilton and Kimberly Blackford Kevin Spacey L’Wren Scott and Mick Jagger I whisper to Harrison [Ford], “That looks just like Johnny Depp.” Harrison rolls his eyes and reluctantly introduces me to his friend . . . Johnny Depp. The Daily Mail announces Her Royal Highness Queen Elizabeth has enjoyed a private screening of The King’s Speech and is “moved” by the film. With no proof the Queen has actually seen the film, press agents send out a global press release thanking her Majesty for the endorsement. FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 24 Mid-day, I arrive at The Beverly Hills Hotel. As the housekeepers unpack my bags upstairs I peek into the Polo Lounge and find Warren Beatty in a booth. I tell him I’m rooting for his wife, Annette Benning, and love her film, The Kids Are All Right. Warren says The Social Network will win. This year I am two days late arriving to Oscar weekend. I am shown to a very, very small room—the size of a broom closet. Uncharacteristically, I have a slight melt down. I am moved. The housekeepers run down the hall with my clothes flying. The hotel is sold out, so I get someone else’s room. Another unsuspecting victim checking in downstairs will get the broom closet. It is cold, grey and rainy. Taffeta, organdy and embroidered silk evening clothes hang in my closet. I stay in my sweaters and fur coat, and head to Arianna Huffington’s home in Beverly Hills where she and Wendi Murdoch are hosting a party for Tom Freston’s wife, the beautiful, blonde Kathy. Her book is called Veganist: Lose Weight, Get Healthy, Change the World—perfect for monks. Arianna has just sold the Huffington Post to AOL for $315 million dollars and is rumored to have personally landed around $20 million. She is euphoric as she greets Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban at the door. Other drenched power players include Disney’s Bob Iger and wife Willow Bay,Fox’s Jim Gianopulos, Candice Bergen and journalist daughter Chloe Malle, Google’s Eric Schmidt, Oliver Stone escorting his daughter Tara and avoiding questions about Charlie Sheen, Moby, Jamie Niven, Brian Grazer, Vivi Nevo, CBS’s Les Moonves and Julie Chen, Rob Reiner, Paramount’s Brad Grey and fiancé Cassandra Huysentruyt and Jeff Bezos. Hors d’oeuvres include pigs in blankets—a food group not mentioned in Kathy’s book. The action migrates to UTA Jim Burkus’ home for a party for True Grit’s Ethan and Joel Coen. I pass Ron Howard on the way in and he says, “Keep me on your list.” Is he kidding? Sunrise and Mark Ruffalo, Focus Feature’s James Shamus, Nancy Meyers and John Goldwyn mingle. Adorable Hallie Steinfeld is there with her parents. I am trying to fix her up with Justin Bieber. She giggles, “Peg, I am only 14.” I am face to face with Harrison Ford and stupidly tell him I love him in Morning Glory. He’s looking at me in utter disbelief, but I will not shut up. A gorgeous guy is inches away in a hat and glasses. I whisper to Harrison, “That looks just like Johnny Depp.” Harrison rolls his eyes and reluctantly introduces me to his friend . . . Johnny Depp. I babble a bit about his great work then run for cover in a corner next to my buddy, Jerry Bruckheimer. I head over to the CAA/Bryan Lourd’s “Friday Night Party.” Torrential rains and horrific winds cause a traffic jam that makes it impossible to get near the house. The world’s most famous faces cower under black umbrellas and make a run for it. Bryan Lourd and Bruce Bozzi receive friends at the door all night. Inside, Uma Thurman tells me she finally moved into a doorman building in New York after being terrorized by stalkers for years. Ben Walker talks about Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, which he is about to shoot, while his fiancé, Mamie Gummer, looks sexy shivering in a white satin gown. Producer Jon Kilik mentions he oversaw a new cut of Julian Schnabel’s Miral, to be released in March. Bennett Miller, standing with Kristin Gore, says Sony loves his new film, Moneyball, and Brad Pitt is terrific. (When is Brad Pitt not terrific?) Sandy Gallin tells me he has an actual job decorating Jeffrey Katzenberg’s home. I congratulate Barry Levinson’s son Sam, a director, for winning the writing award at Sundance for his first film, Another Happy Day. Also seen floating around are Taylor Swift and Jake Gyllenhaal—but not together—Sean Penn, Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, Anderson Cooper, Hilary Swank, Kelly Ripa, Paul Haggis, Marisa Tomei, Kate Beckinsale, Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher, Kate Hudson, Gerard Butler, Renee Zellweger with Bradley Cooper, Biutiful director Alejandro Gonzalez-Inarritu, Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal, Ellen Barkin (who is headed to Broadway in The Normal Heart this spring) and CAA’s Kevin Huvane, Richard Lovett and Hylda Queally. Sony Classic’s Michael Barker tells me The Social Network will win. Tired celebs try to go home, but limo lock is at a standstill. Cell phones don’t work in the area. Two hundred swells become party prisoners and happily hang out till 5 a.m. SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 26 Out comes the sun and dries up all the rain. IAC chairmen and owner of Newsweek/The Daily Beast Barry Diller and his wife Diane Von Furstenberg (with her kids Alex and Tatiana) host their 15th annual lunch for Graydon Carter in their Coldwater Canyon home. Barry introduces me to his star guest, Gov. Jerry Brown, just elected to his third (nonconsecutive) term as California governor. Like last year, enormous clear plastic tents are erected on the hill near the house. Long wooden picnic tables sit on oriental rugs covering the soggy ground. VIPs wears winter clothes, comfy sweaters and sensible shoes. I arrive in a fur coat. Stephen Gaghan and Minnie Mortimer Scarlett Johansson Charlize Theron Lourdes Leon and Madonna Armie Hammer Kate Beckinsale Aaron Sorkin Georgina Chapman Hilary Swank Cameron Diaz Wendi Murdoch, Kathy Freston and Arianna Huffington Natalie Portman Brian Grazer and Jeff Bezos Tom Ford Everybody knows everybody, and it doesn’t matter if you have a hit film or T.V. show this season. Oprah Winfrey kisses David Geffen, casually chats with former Disney C.E.O. Michael Eisner and current Sony Chief Sir Howard Stringer and Rob Weisenthal. Brett Ratner arrives with his houseguest Jean Pigozzi, who is allowed to take photographs. Graydon greets people with chic wife Anna by his side. Ingrid Sischy and Sandy Brant, Rupert Murdoch, Ron Meyer, Francesco Clemente with his twin boys and Tom Ford chat each other up. People to watch include pregnant Victoria and David Beckham with Lynn Wyatt, Fran Lebowitz, Larry Gagosian and Shala Monroque, Ben Silverman, Debbie and Allen I head over to the CAA/Bryan Lourd’s “Friday Night Party.” Torrential rains and horrific winds cause a traffic jam that makes it impossible to get near the house. The world’s most famous faces cower under black umbrellas and make a run for it. Grubman, Sotheby’s Tobias Meyer and Mark Fletcher and Stephen Gaghan and Mini Mortimer wearing her oversized cat glasses. Bruce Cohen has invited me to the Oscar broadcast rehearsal. Inside the Kodak Theater’s massive auditorium, I find a seat next to his proud parents. I watch Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem come out in white dinner jackets and flub their lines as they pretend to present Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Original Screenplay. Josh will later tell me that their acting methods are completely opposite: he’s a quick study and is very creative and comfortable ad-libbing; Javier, whose mother tongue is Spanish, likes to have every syllable printed out to study with a dialect coach. Life-size photos on cardboard plaques are taped to each nominee’s chair. I memorize their location so when I return Sunday I can quickly kiss them all. Back at the Beverly Hills hotel I slip into my black tulle Dennis Basso cocktail dress with a plunging neckline and put on my mother’s jewels. Jim Coleman takes me to the “Night Before Party” in the hotel. This is Jeffrey Katzenberg’s 9th annual A-lister event benefiting The Motion Picture & Television Fund where they raise $6.5 million dollars in 1 night. I walk into Valentino, who gives me an approving once-over. I tell him and Giancarlo Giammetti that Woody Allen’s new film, Midnight in Paris, is opening the Cannes Film Festival and they must bring the yacht. Elton John and David Furnish join our conversation so of course we ask for intimate details about baby Zachary. I segue over to Amy Adams, who, like them, mentions she hates leaving her baby in the hotel room. Next stop is Kate Capshaw in a black bowler hat chatting with Steven Spielberg’s god-daughter, Gwyneth Paltrow. I have known Steven for years (in 1982 I was a publicist on E.T.). I now tell him I’m going to the Lincoln Center opening of War Horse with Kathy Kennedy and Frank Marshall and cannot wait to see his movie version. I meet sweet Jennifer Aniston, her new haircut and her perfect little body. Her date tells me her secret is a half-hour on the treadmill everyday—such an understatement. I tell Jesse Eisenberg I was on his plane home from the Baftas last week, but he was hiding under his hoodie. He says innocently, “You should have said ‘hello.’ I always cover my head because I think my curls make me look like a girl.” The charity gives us a coupon booklet redeemable at various booths. Rich people run around like lunatics, collecting gifts for their housekeepers. Among the shoppers are Steven and Heather Mnuchin, Viacom’s Deborah and Philippe Dauman, Tamara Mellon, Christine Taylor and Ben Stiller, Cate Blanchet, Susan and Robert Downey Jr. and Debra and Hugh Jackman. Next stop is The Weinstein Company’s party at the Soho House sponsored by MontBlanc. Long gone are the funky Miramax Saturday night soirees where nominees spoofed their own films in homemade costumes and ad-libbed hilarious skits. No more grown men dressed as Anna Paquin playing the piano in hopes of winning a Max Award. As I come in, a 400-pound gorilla refuses to let me on the elevator. Once on, I see Jennifer Lopez in the corner and remind her we met on Len Blavatnik’s yacht in Cannes. She graciously pretends to remember me. Her manager, Benny Medina, is kicking me. I slip into Colin Firth’s booth to have a tête-à-tête with him and his wife Livia Giuggioli. Jokingly, I suggest he say “I’m speechless” when he wins. Colin patiently assures me many people, far more clever than I, thought of this. He then says that others are waging bets on whether he might subconsciously stutter. I grill him about his wardrobe, assuming he will be wearing a new Tom Ford tuxedo. He tells me both he and Ford will be in older Ford models. I tell him I made rich-butthrifty Charles Ferguson, director of Inside Job, spend $6,000 dollars for a new Tom Ford tux. In the back room, Jennifer Lopez is now seated with Weinstein’s wife, Georgina Chapman. Helena Bonham Carter, her live-in-lover Tim Burton and her mother Elena circulate. Star power includes Adrien Brody, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Cameron Diaz, Camilla Belle, Chace Vera Farmiga Adrien Brody Andrew Garfield Oliver Stone and Tara Stone Claire Danes and Hugh Dancy Hailee Steinfeld Taylor Swift Donald and Melania Trump Donna Karan Lynn Wyatt Barry Diller Jon Hamm and Jennifer Westfeldt Anderson Cooper Chloe Malle and Candice Bergen Diane von Furstenberg Tory Burch Crawford, Claire Danes and Hugh Dancy, Darren Aronofsky, director John Wells, Kerry Washington, Piers Morgan, Rachel Zoe, Sean Parker, Zack Braff and Leonardo Dicaprio with Bar Rafaeli. Speech filmmakers are functioning on high anxiety. SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 27 Producer Donna Gigliotti is my date to the awards. We are both so nervous we arrive at the Kodak Theater at 3 p.m. and nobody is there. We are driven around for an hour. When we arrive back at the world’s most famous red carpet, I guide Donna through security check-in to the extreme right to make sure we get on camera. I teach her the red carpet hustle, which is five steps forward, three steps back, one inch behind a couture-clad nominee. We greet Kevin Huvane as Sandra Bullock is talking to ABC-TV and a billion people see me wearing a black Marchesa gown. Five steps forward, three steps back, we next meet Gwyneth Paltrow, and I hook up the back of her dress while another billion people see me correct the fashion malfunction. Five steps forward, three steps back, we’re now posing behind Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban. Our Blackberrys begin buzzing; the world has seen us. James Franco and Anne Hathaway are hip hosts. This is the year of no surprises. But it isn’t until Hilary Swank yells out Hooper’s name for Best Director that Harvey’s gang finally realizes they are getting the Oscar for Best Picture after all. Harvey is sitting in Spielberg’s seat as Spielberg announces the win from the stage. Producers Iain Canning, Emile Sherman and Gareth Unwin leap up and kiss each other.Six months of grueling work have finally paid off. King George VI and Harvey Weinstein now share the journey of a single man who triumphs over adversity. At the Governor’s ball, held above the Kodak Theater, the winners triumphantly sachet around the room holding their heavy eight-pound gold statues. An hour later there is a migration to the Vanity Fair party hosted by Graydon Carter at Jeff Klein’s Sunset Tower Hotel. The invitation features a gold hologram that transmits a radio frequency of a photo and details about the guest to VF staff as they arrive. The next day “Page Six” will report that the backup private security firm is run by a former Israeli operative, when in fact they are Irish Catholics from Staten Island. There’s a hierarchy of arrival times. At 5 p.m. the inner circle of Graydon’s 141 best friends attend a seated dinner. They include Barry Diller and Diane von Furstenberg, Francis Ford Coppola, Jon Hamm and Jennifer Westfeldt, Betsey Bloomingdale, Tory Burch and Lyor Cohen, Carolina and Reinaldo Herrera, L’Wren Scott and Sir Mick Jagger, Naomi Watts and Liev Schreiber, Wendi Stark, George Hamilton, Judd Apatow, Jackie and Joan Collins, Donna Karan and Steve Martin. The best and the brightest talent in town arrive at 9 p.m. Every single winner shows up. Also there are Justin Bieber and his date Selena Gomez, Michelle Williams, Emma Stone, Steve Tyler and Liv Tyler, Andrew Garfield, Jude Law, Armie Hammer, Vera Farmiga, Kevin Spacey, Charlize Theron, Anne Hathaway, Winter’s Bone star-of-tomorrow Jennifer Lawrence, Taylor Hackford and Helen Mirren, Scarlett Johansson, Isla Fischer and Sasha Baron Cohen, Tom Hanks, Sean Penn, Renee Zellweger and Bradley Cooper and Jane Fonda after her play, 33 Variations. I introduce Melania and Donald Trump to David O. Russell as The Trumpster gushes about The Fighter. David tells Donald he used to be a waiter/bar tender at many of Trump’s parties. Donald smiles as if looking at yet another apprentice. He then offers me a ride home on his plane; he’s leaving in 10 minutes. Too bad James Franco didn’t know because he is presently sitting on a commercial flight back to school, skipping his own after-party. The rest of the guests’ social standings are determined by half-hour increments. VF’s Beth Kseniak, Matt Ullian and Jane Sarkin tell me the list is cut down to 800 this year. At 11:30 p.m. there is another celebrity migration up the hill to Madonna manager Guy Oseary’s house. Earlier in the I introduce Melania and Donald Trump to David O. Russell . . . David tells Donald he used to be a waiter/bar tender at many of Trump’s parties. Donald smiles as if looking at yet another apprentice. evening, Madonna came down the hill to pose in a risqué see-thru outfit with daughter Lourdes. Madonna and co-host Demi Moore are able to lure the crème de la crème with the promise of dancing and no cameras. MONDAY, FEBRUARY 28 A winner’s work is never done. Colin Firth, Tom Hooper and David Seidler show up at 4:30 a.m. at The Four Seasons Hotel for a live broadcast on “The Today Show.” Functioning on an adrenalin rush, they return to the Kodak Theater with Geoffrey Rush to appear on Oprah’s live broadcast. By the end of this year’s thrilling race between two great producers—Scott Rudin and Harvey Weinstein— Facebook and Twitter are credited for aiding political justice from the streets of Cairo to Tripoli. But the British film with the most heart wins as one single human voice can still make a difference. The king has spoken. ✦ Fran Lebowitz Julie Chen Ellen Barkin Naomi Watts Joan Collins Chace Crawford", "metadata": {"source_filename": "TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012700.txt", "parent_doc_id":

Cinque can be seen in a video obtained by the Palm Beach Daily News , cheering loudly as a tuxedo-clad Trump runs through a number of campaign promises before the hundreds of guests attending the New Year's Eve bash the President-elect threw at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Saturday. \"The taxes are coming down, regulations are coming off, we're going to get rid of Obamacare,\" Trump can be heard saying as an exuberant Cinque stands next to him, pumping his fists into the air. Cinque's Sunday appearance with Trump might raise some eyebrows. Beyond a 1989 felony conviction for possessing nearly $100,000 worth of stolen artwork, Cinque \"used to be friends with John Gotti,\" according to a New York Magazine profile from 1995 . Cinque was also \"shot three times and left for dead\" in a 1980 incident that authorities described as \"a hit,\" according to the profile. Further, Saturday's Mar-a-Lago party was far from the first time Cinque cheered on for Trump. An Associated Press report from this spring showed that the American Academy of Hospitality Sciences, a company owned and operated by Cinque, has awarded more than a dozen of Trump's golf courses, hotels, casinos and private clubs with so-called \"Star Diamond\" awards \"of true excellence in hospitality.\" The same report also found that about half of the roughly 30 people listed as \"trustees\" to the company are Trump friends or business associates. Trump, meanwhile, was listed on the company's website as its \"ambassador extraordinaire,\" and he even appeared in a 2009 tribute video to Cinque in which he said, \"There's nobody like him. He's a special guy.\" But when asked by reporters about Cinque in May, Trump denied knowing anything about him or his criminal past. \"If a guy's going to give you an award, you take it,\" the President-elect said at the time. \"You don't tend to look up his whole life story.\" The Trump transition team did not immediately return a request for comment on how the President-elect knows Cinque or why they appeared together Saturday. While standing alongside Cinque, Trump also took a moment to address the terror attack that left scores of nightclub revelers in Istanbul dead over the weekend — and how the bloodbath somehow necessitates a Mexican border wall. \"We will build a wall, you know that. We will build a wall,\" the President-elect told the raucous crowd. HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033210 \"And speaking of walls,\" he continued. \"In Turkey tonight — has anybody heard? Big disaster took place in Turkey tonight. Many, many, many people killed...It's a horror show. So we're going to get things running properly.\" ISIS claimed responsibility for the Saturday attack , which left at least 39 people dead and dozens more wounded, calling the lone gunman who carried out the massacre a \"heroic soldier of the caliphate.\" The suspect had yet to be named and located by Turkish authorities early Tuesday. The President-elect made building a wall along the country's southern border one of his main campaign talking points, frequently promising his supporters that it will be a \"great\" and \"beautiful\" wall. But his pledge to construct a border barrier has gone under several renditions, with the President-elect admitting in November that it might actually end up \"part wall, part fence.\" HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033211", "metadata": {"source_filename": "TEXT-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_033210.txt", "parent_doc_id": "TEXT-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_033210.txt", "chunk_index": 0, "entities": ["New York Magazine", "Nick Trump", "He's", "There's", "Cinque Trump", "Tuesday The President-elect", "Cinque", "Cinque Importance High Jeffrey", "Saturday The", "You", "Subject Trump", "President-elect", "New Year's", "Turkey", "Palm Beach Daily News", "Big", "Turkish", "Trump An Associated Press", "Hospitality Sciences", "And", "Star Diamond", "Saturday While", "Mar-a-Lago", "Further Saturday's Mar-a-Lago", "Joseph Joey No Socks Cinque", "American Academy", "November", "Cinque's Sunday", "ISIS", "Obamacare Trump", "Beyond", "But", "President-elect Donald Trump", "The Trump", "New Year's Eve", "Mexican", "HOUSE OVERSIGHT", "Many", "May Trump", "Trump", "From Nicholas Ribis____________________________________________ Sent", "Saturday", "Trump's", "John Gotti", "Gambino", "Istanbul", "Florida"]}}], "reference_answer": {"text": "Human cash flow (F) is influenced by the pay (z) received, which can be allocated towards invested consumption (C_).

Klobuchar is the daughter of Rose (née Heuberger) and Jim Klobuchar. She has one younger sister. Her parents divorced when Klobuchar was 15. Klobuchar attended public schools in Plymouth and was valedictorian at Wayzata High School. In 1982, she graduated from Yale magna cum laude with a B.A. in political science. During college, she was a member of the Yale College Democrats, the Feminist Caucus, and the improv troupe Suddenly Susan. During her time at Yale, Klobuchar spent time as an intern for then Vice President, and former Minnesota Senator, Walter Mondale.

These are the dimensions associated with emotion, and when taken away, cause us to perceive the other as an object. Since objects can’t feel pain or joy, we can’t share in their experience because they lack experience altogether. If that is the case, then when we perceive any human group that has been dehumanized in this particular way, there should be little to no activity in those areas of the brain associated with thinking, feeling, wanting, and believing. To explore this possibility, the social psychologist Susan Fiske placed subjects in a brain scanner and presented photographs of either extreme out-group members, such as the homeless and drug addicts, or photographs of other groups such as the elderly, middle-class Americans, and the rich. When viewing the extreme out-group, not only did Fiske see little activity in an area critically related to self-awareness and the process of thinking about others thoughts and emotions — the medial prefrontal cortex — but she also observed an intense increase of activity in the insula, a brain area that is recruited when we experience disgust. Fiske’s results highlight the dangers of dehumanization. Once we turn off areas of the brain that are involved in thinking about others’ thoughts and emotions, and turn on areas involved in disgust, we have set ourselves up for moral disengagement. As the distinguished American psychologist Albert Bandura has documented through decades of research, moral disengagement allows people to justify harm by transforming lethal motives into morally justified and even benevolent ones. Moral disengagement allows us to excuse ourselves from moral responsibility, either disregarding the harm imposed or convincing ourselves that it was justified, even obligatory. In several international studies of school-aged children, results consistently show that those who are most morally disengaged are most likely to engage in various forms of aggression, including bullying and repeated criminal offenses. These same children are also least likely to engage in helpful behavior, revealing that moral disengagement dispenses with the typical process of self-censure and sanctioning that we carry around when we are morally engaged. Ina study of American prison personnel involved in death penalty sentences, executioners were more morally disengaged than support staff or prison guards. Executioners were more likely to dehumanize the convicted prisoner and provide moral and economic justifications. Executioners also felt less guilt because they had developed a narrative to justify their actions, one that ascribed complete fault and responsibility to the victim. Support staff flipped in the opposite direction, fully involved with the weighty moral issues associated with ending someone’s life. In a study of people’s political attitudes, those with strong right wing authoritarian views, commonly associated with fascism and submission to authority, were more likely to support war by means of morally disengaging. In particular, they were most likely to support war by justifying its necessity and trivializing the harm that will necessarily arise — for Hauser Chapter 3.

Cinque can be seen in a video obtained by the Palm Beach Daily News , cheering loudly as a tuxedo-clad Trump runs through a number of campaign promises before the hundreds of guests attending the New Year's Eve bash the President-elect threw at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Saturday. \"The taxes are coming down, regulations are coming off, we're going to get rid of Obamacare,\" Trump can be heard saying as an exuberant Cinque stands next to him, pumping his fists into the air. Cinque's Sunday appearance with Trump might raise some eyebrows. Beyond a 1989 felony conviction for possessing nearly $100,000 worth of stolen artwork, Cinque \"used to be friends with John Gotti,\" according to a New York Magazine profile from 1995 . Cinque was also \"shot three times and left for dead\" in a 1980 incident that authorities described as \"a hit,\" according to the profile. Further, Saturday's Mar-a-Lago party was far from the first time Cinque cheered on for Trump. An Associated Press report from this spring showed that the American Academy of Hospitality Sciences, a company owned and operated by Cinque, has awarded more than a dozen of Trump's golf courses, hotels, casinos and private clubs with so-called \"Star Diamond\" awards \"of true excellence in hospitality.\" The same report also found that about half of the roughly 30 people listed as \"trustees\" to the company are Trump friends or business associates. Trump, meanwhile, was listed on the company's website as its \"ambassador extraordinaire,\" and he even appeared in a 2009 tribute video to Cinque in which he said, \"There's nobody like him. He's a special guy.\" But when asked by reporters about Cinque in May, Trump denied knowing anything about him or his criminal past. \"If a guy's going to give you an award, you take it,\" the President-elect said at the time. \"You don't tend to look up his whole life story.\" The Trump transition team did not immediately return a request for comment on how the President-elect knows Cinque or why they appeared together Saturday. While standing alongside Cinque, Trump also took a moment to address the terror attack that left scores of nightclub revelers in Istanbul dead over the weekend — and how the bloodbath somehow necessitates a Mexican border wall. \"We will build a wall, you know that. We will build a wall,\" the President-elect told the raucous crowd. HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033210 \"And speaking of walls,\" he continued. \"In Turkey tonight — has anybody heard? Big disaster took place in Turkey tonight. Many, many, many people killed...It's a horror show.

This much we know - the Fall elections are shaping up to be a referendum on the most divisive American President in memory. The battle for potential Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh's nomination this fall will only amplify the polarity of the political debate that is already deeply overwrought on both sides. The rising tide of pressure on Donald Trump from the Mueller investigation shows no sign of ebbing. Unless the underlying political dynamics are disrupted, the outcomes of these unprecedented events will still leave us with the same unsatisfactory two front battlefield of the 2016 Presidential election. Watching these unrelenting, compounding events since our discussion in May, I am guessing we are all asking the same question: now what? For the 48 percent of Americans who believe Donald Trump should not be in the White House, perhaps we too want our own \"chaos\" candidate in 2020? Should Trump run again, this could be a \"break glass\" moment for the majority of Americans who don't support him. Do we want to break the genteel precedents of two parties running their ceremonious and seemingly illogical nominating process to select a candidate? (Why do Iowa and New Hampshire play such outsized roles? What kind of small-d democratic process relies on superdelegates?) The system failed in 2016, with both parties producing terribly flawed candidates in a race to the bottom. We need to build a back-up plan in the event the system fails again. HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026499 It's possible, of course, that we won't need a third-party candidate. Trump could decide not to run for whatever reason. The Democrats could nominate a winning 2020 candidate. I am not willing to take those bets. The ideal candidate for a new third party is someone who is widely perceived to be that rare combination of both good and great. We are looking for a proven leader of men and women, someone with clear, democratic — and moral — values that reflect the best of America, not our worst. We know people like this on the national stage now. As a thought experiment, consider the possibilities of a ticket outside the partisan lanes and imagine the chemistry of radical combinations: Biden/Romney? Bill Gates/Hogan? Bloomberg/Haley? Howard Schultz/Bob Corker? Sandberg/Kasich? As we have discussed narrow path to electing the first president outside the two major party primary system in 168 years is more navigable than most think. Heading into 2020, converging trends in American's demands for a third party (a historic high of 61%), disapproval of Donald Trump holding steady above 50%, and the increasingly leftward drift of the Democratic Party suggest that electorate may be susceptible to merits of a new centrist party. Cynics will say that the structural impediments of ballot and presidential debate access, the overwhelming advantages of legacy parties' fundraising and voter turn-out operations preordain failure, but they're wrong; the legal and logistical hurdles are amenable to a combination of lawyering and resources. The bigger, more consequential factors come in terms of candidate quality and policy. I believe a candidate with five specific characteristics including a unique — and purposefully non-specific - policy agenda could limbo a win. • This is what I think a successful third-party candidate looks like; a dream third party ticket would start off with enough name ID to be an instant contender. Building the name ID to run nationally is just too long and expensive of a process to accomplish in the 28 months until the next presidential election. We can't beat a celebrity without some celebrity of our own, whether from politics, sports, business, or entertainment. Instantaneous name ID is so crucial because the candidate must HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026500 start out in striking distance in any three-way poll against Trump and a fill-in-the-blank Democratic flavor-of-the day candidate. The media and political class will predetermine irrelevance otherwise. • A Democrat-leaning candidate would have to top the ideal third-party ticket. We need someone with a shot at snaking a plurality of the vote in the blue states Hillary Clinton won (227 electoral votes), but moderate enough to win a plurality in some combination of Trump states like Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan (another 119 votes). The right candidate may even to put North Carolina, Ohio, Indiana in play for a centrist bi-partisan ticket as well (totaling an electoral sweep of 464 elector votes). A right leaning candidate would meet the same fate as a primary challenger to Trump — for all intents and purposes we need to assume that 36% of voters won't be cleaved from Trump under any circumstances and run to win around them. The deep red states would be off the table entirely. • With the Trump reality show airing daily, voters are now expecting to take their politics with a side of entertainment. Heretofore, ratings will matter no matter how dry the policy topic. Surely Stephen Colbert would gladly sacrifice his executive producer Chris Licht to produce a daily comedic segment of this dream candidate interviewing Americans in truck stops and McDonald's across the country. A few of the \"Saturday Night Live\" script writers could certainly be enticed to disguise serious debates as informative amusement. Any candidate must be committed to a near daily cadence of high quality, compelling video production. It will be especially crucial to keep the voters' attention during what will be a raucous Democratic primary season. Rules governing access to the general election debate stage dictate that a candidate enjoy support of at least 15% of voters in the months leading up to the general election. • This dream candidate would pledge to serve only four years and address all of the U.S.'s ticking time bombs like Social Security, Medicare, health care reform, climate change, money in politics, gerrymandering, and infrastructure investment in a single term. This one-and-done term decouples our candidate from the usual politics and gives them the power of promise and deliver decisive action. A four-year term pledge ensures governance independent of campaign finance concerns and HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026501 narrow special interests inherent to winning re-election. This \"fix-it\" ticket would promise to force decisions on all the underlying structural policy matters damaging America's long-term prospects and distorting our democracy. No more kicking the can down the road. • This candidate should also pledge to push for laws passed that reflect the will of simple majorities in Congress. Congress now only allows bills to move forward when a \"majority of a majority\" supports the policy and on many levels seems fundamentally broken. This third-party president could force votes based on a transparent reading of where the votes lie via coalition building. The Senate filibuster power will present a high hurdle, but a third-party candidate would be a de facto disruptor of the two-party system. Party discipline could well break down, and moderates in both parties could form a powerful, decisive block willing to work with the new President. The policies passed into law may not be ideal for either Democrats or Republicans, but for the major agenda items that must be addressed for America's long-term health, an imperfect fix that corrects course is better than those that now have us hurtling toward national bankruptcy. And if no candidate secures 270 electoral votes in 2020? The House of Representatives would choose the next president. In 2016, reports suggested Michael Bloomberg declined to run on a third-party ticket for fear of splitting support from Hillary Clinton and throwing the election to a GOP-controlled House of Representatives who would then vote to select the president. The fear was the GOP controlled House would have just elected Trump. Would Democratic control of the House mean that the House would pick an alternative to Trump as president? Each state delegation has a single vote in selecting a president and it is the incoming Congress - the class elected in 2020 that would decide the election. But no matter which party has the speaker's chair, the GOP would almost certainly have the upper hand in the majority of state delegations controlled. Would the state delegations pick a president based on party majority control of the delegation, the winner of the popular vote in each state or their own calculations as to who is best for America? Precedent suggests that delegations use secret ballots, which means individual lawmakers may vote their consciences. HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026502 If we recruit this ideal candidate; threading the needle of name ID, a center-left bent, a TV- savvy campaign team and a pledge to serve only four years with an apartisan agenda, money and campaign expertise would certainly follow. And 50 state ballot access is a function of time (starting in the fall of 2019 would be prudential) and hard work as we have discussed and many of you have exhaustively war- gamed. Part and parcel of this effort would be motivating the often politically lackadaisical middle to vote. The raft of new technologies in data targeting and biometric mobile voting technology could transform the electorate in the next few, amping voter participation and injecting the voices of moderates (both in political views and level of political interest) into the process. And any third-party effort must incorporate advocacy for accelerated adaption of these all but inevitable voter verification tools. I believe Silicon Valley could be game-changing allies in this effort. I am sure none of us doubt that chaos could potentially be unleashed by jamming three viable candidates into a two-party system. An election that ends up in the House of Representatives is an uncontrollable, murky and ancient process. But might that be a less scary prospect than relying on the Democrats to nominate a candidate who can beat Trump in 2020? I look forward to talking more about all of our ideas on this hopeful project in coming weeks. Please feel free to call me to discuss. Thank you for taking time to review this note.

The freeze would not be open- ended, but last for 10 months, as a way of boosting the effort to restart negotiations. It would apply to new construction, not work already underway. And it would exclude the post-1967 neighborhoods inside the expanded city limits of Jerusalem. Like his other moves, it was also dismissed as insignificant by the Palestinians. Though there was a formal restarting of the talks, they went almost nowhere during the period of the freeze, which Bibi cited as a reason for not extending it further. From then on, the negotiations produced even less. I didn’t buy the narrative that this was entirely Bibi’s fault. Abu Mazen remained steadfastly, deliberately passive. Obviously not inclined to take the risk of further widening his rift with Hamas in Gaza, he was content to echo the Obama administration’s argument that nothing could happen until there was a settlement freeze. Once the freeze was announced, he went through the motions, avoiding all the difficult issues, in the expectation Washington would ensure the freeze was renewed. President Obama’s initial Mideast moves had made it much easier for Abu Mazen to avoid any serious engagement. In contrast to past presidents, Obama had placed almost all of the onus for progress on Israel. But the end result also suited Bibi. Though I never entirely gave up hope of persuading him it was in Israel’s interest to seek a resolution of our conflict with the Palestinians, it became more evident as the months went on that his aim was simply to keep things ticking over, and avoid any major new crisis. He appointed an old personal friend — a corporate lawyer named Yitzhak Molcho — as our negotiator. I finally realized how pointless the exercise was when, during a visit to the United States, I found myself in New York at the same time as Molcho. We met at the Israeli consulate. We spoke in detail about the state of the negotiations. With Molcho still in the room, I phoned Bibi in Jerusalem on the secure phone line. I said I’d just been updated on the talks, and it seemed clear there were a number of suggestions Israel could make, with no domestic political risk but with every prospect of improving the atmosphere and accelerating progress. “Yitzhak is one of Israel’s top lawyers,” I said. “He’s struck dozens of deals in his life. But he strikes a deal when that’s what his client wants. You are the client. If you tell him: bring me back the best deal you can — not a peace treaty, just a deal on a specific issue — he’ Il do it. But if his brief is simply to negotiate, he can go on negotiating forever. And it’s pretty clear me that’s his brief.” Bibi insisted I was wrong. He said that what I saw as time-wasting was simple prudence, to make sure the negotiations bore fruit. But his approach never changed.

In February, the Miami Herald filed a federal court motion in the Southern District of New York, seeking access to documents that were sealed in the Maxwell case. The motion, which was not opposed by Roberts, could have cast light on the full scope of Epstein’s possible sex trafficking operation, who was involved and whether it was covered up. Maxwell has opposed the Herald’s motion, which was denied in August. The Herald is appealing. Today, Epstein has a new private jet, which takes him around the world. Flight records show that he spends most of his time on his private island, Little St. James in the U.S. Virgin Islands, which he now lists as his permanent residence. He is registered in New York and the U.S. Virgin Islands as a sex offender. New Mexico, where he owns a sprawling ranch, does not list him as a convicted sex offender. As part of its investigation, the Herald learned that in 2013, the federal government conceded that it had given Epstein what it called “valuable consideration” for information he provided to the FBI as part of his plea deal.

By the time Shimon Peres, the Nobel Prize-winning prime minister of Israel who helped resolve many of the more intangible issues, died more peacefully aged 93 in 2016, he had become one of the most accomplished statesmen of our age. But perhaps the greatest casualty from that era – when there were genuine expectations on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian divide that the conflict might be resolved peacefully – has been the peace process itself, which today is almost nonexistent. When, for example, I told an Arab ambassador acquaintance I was going to see a preview of the play, he simply remarked: “No one talks about the peace process any more. It doesn’t exist.” This makes Roger’s examination of one of the most unlikely diplomatic dialogues ever undertaken all the more poignant, as it harks back to an era when reconciliation seemed genuinely possible. The task facing the rival delegates when they first meet is a daunting one. For the Israelis, if the fact became known that they were talking to the PLO, the government would most likely fall. For the Palestinians, it would mean an assassin’s bullet. At the heart of this danse macabre stands Rød-Larsen, whom I met on several occasions in Jerusalem in the Nineties when the hard work had begun on implementing the deal. A quiet, patient man, he never seemed to be entirely comfortable with the rough-house atmosphere of the region, where disputes were often more likely to be resolved through rocks and rubber bullets than rational persuasion. Toby Stephens’s portrayal of Rød- Larsen gives him a great deal more zest and personality than I recall, but this neatly nuanced performance is key to the pace of this fast-moving, entertaining take on the events (Rogers has said that, in order to liven up what might otherwise seem a prosaic and convoluted political process, he studied the plays of Noël Coward). My favourite scene from the play is the one where the lead Israeli negotiator, taking a break from the negotiations, entertains his Palestinian counterparts by giving an impersonation of Arafat as an effeminate narcissist, a portrayal I found entirely plausible from my own encounters with the PLO leader, whose vanity knew no bounds. Uri Savir, who was deputed by Peres to run the Israeli side of the negotiations, was someone else I got to know during that period. An urbane multi-linguist of an academic disposition, I generally found Uri to be softly spoken and thoughtful when discussing regional issues. Philip Arditti’s portrayal of him in the play, though, makes him out to be more like the uncompromising, muscular Israeli type, more usually found in the ranks of the security forces than in the diplomatic service. Depictions in theatre of almost anything to do with the Middle East tend to stir strong passions among audiences. I was particularly struck by Rogers’ sympathetic understanding of the Palestinian predicament. “I was very anxious about the combustibility of it,” said Rogers in a recent interview. “I assumed there would be controversy [in America] only because someone would be enraged that I had allowed the ‘other side’ to have their say.” Certainly Peter Polycarpou’s depiction of Ahmed Qurei, the Palestinian finance minister sent by Arafat to make peace, admirably captures the conflicting emotions of enduring the pain of exile while seeking to wreak terrible vengeance on the Israeli occupiers. Indeed, for all the quips and light-hearted banter, Oslo is, at heart, a deeply emotional drama. When the Israelis finally strike a deal with the Palestinians during a telephone call to Arafat’s headquarters in Tunis, they think they can hear music playing in the background. In fact it is the battle-hardened veterans of the PLO sobbing at the prospect of being allowed to return to their homeland. Ultimately, the play is an implicit tragedy about the failure of both sides to build a lasting peace on the basis of the painful concessions made during Reproduced by Gorkana under licence from the NLA (newspapers), CLA (magazines), FT (Financial Times/ft.com) or other copyright owner.

By the time Shimon Peres, the Nobel Prize-winning prime minister of Israel who helped resolve many of the more intangible issues, died more peacefully aged 93 in 2016, he had become one of the most accomplished statesmen of our age. But perhaps the greatest casualty from that era – when there were genuine expectations on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian divide that the conflict might be resolved peacefully – has been the peace process itself, which today is almost nonexistent. When, for example, I told an Arab ambassador acquaintance I was going to see a preview of the play, he simply remarked: “No one talks about the peace process any more. It doesn’t exist.” This makes Roger’s examination of one of the most unlikely diplomatic dialogues ever undertaken all the more poignant, as it harks back to an era when reconciliation seemed genuinely possible. The task facing the rival delegates when they first meet is a daunting one. For the Israelis, if the fact became known that they were talking to the PLO, the government would most likely fall. For the Palestinians, it would mean an assassin’s bullet. At the heart of this danse macabre stands Rød-Larsen, whom I met on several occasions in Jerusalem in the Nineties when the hard work had begun on implementing the deal. A quiet, patient man, he never seemed to be entirely comfortable with the rough-house atmosphere of the region, where disputes were often more likely to be resolved through rocks and rubber bullets than rational persuasion. Toby Stephens’s portrayal of Rød- Larsen gives him a great deal more zest and personality than I recall, but this neatly nuanced performance is key to the pace of this fast-moving, entertaining take on the events (Rogers has said that, in order to liven up what might otherwise seem a prosaic and convoluted political process, he studied the plays of Noël Coward). My favourite scene from the play is the one where the lead Israeli negotiator, taking a break from the negotiations, entertains his Palestinian counterparts by giving an impersonation of Arafat as an effeminate narcissist, a portrayal I found entirely plausible from my own encounters with the PLO leader, whose vanity knew no bounds. Uri Savir, who was deputed by Peres to run the Israeli side of the negotiations, was someone else I got to know during that period. An urbane multi-linguist of an academic disposition, I generally found Uri to be softly spoken and thoughtful when discussing regional issues. Philip Arditti’s portrayal of him in the play, though, makes him out to be more like the uncompromising, muscular Israeli type, more usually found in the ranks of the security forces than in the diplomatic service. Depictions in theatre of almost anything to do with the Middle East tend to stir strong passions among audiences. I was particularly struck by Rogers’ sympathetic understanding of the Palestinian predicament. “I was very anxious about the combustibility of it,” said Rogers in a recent interview. “I assumed there would be controversy [in America] only because someone would be enraged that I had allowed the ‘other side’ to have their say.” Certainly Peter Polycarpou’s depiction of Ahmed Qurei, the Palestinian finance minister sent by Arafat to make peace, admirably captures the conflicting emotions of enduring the pain of exile while seeking to wreak terrible vengeance on the Israeli occupiers. Indeed, for all the quips and light-hearted banter, Oslo is, at heart, a deeply emotional drama. When the Israelis finally strike a deal with the Palestinians during a telephone call to Arafat’s headquarters in Tunis, they think they can hear music playing in the background. In fact it is the battle-hardened veterans of the PLO sobbing at the prospect of being allowed to return to their homeland. Ultimately, the play is an implicit tragedy about the failure of both sides to build a lasting peace on the basis of the painful concessions made during Reproduced by Gorkana under licence from the NLA (newspapers), CLA (magazines), FT (Financial Times/ft.com) or other copyright owner.

Attached and below the same. Dear Jeffrey: As requested, the following addresses your two questions / concerns about our proposed Closer To Truth TV series \"The Science of Sleep and Dreams\": (i) Have there been sufficient breakthroughs in Sleep and Dreams (significantly beyond traditional understandings) to justify a major TV series? (ii) Even if 'yes' to (i), is now the proper time for such a foundational series, or are more years needed for corroborative studies and further research to solidify the breakthroughs? In preparing this response, my primary source is Professor Patrick McNamara, Department of Neurology, Boston University School of Medicine, with whom CTT Producer/Director Peter Getzels and I spoke with at length today. Patrick is one of the leading sleep and dream researchers (he himself more dreams). More importantly, he is perhaps the leading chronicler of the field, with many publications (including 26 entries in related encyclopedias). He is co-editor-in-chief of the \"Encyclopedia of Sleep and Dreams\" (2012) and the sole author of the forthcoming \"An Introduction to the Neuroscience of Sleep and Dreams\" (Cambridge University Press, 2018), which intends to present the latest science and to become a main textbook for graduate courses/seminars. Patrick is a CTT contributor and colleague. When we asked Patrick, his first response — \"This is the ideal time to tell the sleep-and-dreams story\" — and he cited (in essence) your two questions, in that (i) the multiple breakthroughs are now sufficiently well corroborated by numerous independent labs such that a substantial foundation for the new, deeper understanding of sleep and dreams is now for the first time (over the past few years) confirmed and established, and (ii) there are now interesting application and critical clinical questions to pose, explore and pursue, such as for the treatment of various mental-related illnesses that have known sleep-related syndromes (e.g., PTSD and Depression). To understand the significance of recent breakthroughs, a defining characteristic of sleep and dreams is that there are two distinct kinds of sleep — REM (rapid-eye-movement) Sleep and NREM (non-rapid-eye- movement) Sleep. Most dreams are associated with REM sleep (though complex). The eye movement gives the eponymous name, but a more important designation defines the two stages in terms of brain waves (electroencephalograph — EEG): REM is Fast-Wave Sleep (similar to the waking state) and NREM Sleep is Slow-Wave Sleep (very different from the waking state). This difference between REM and NREM sleep has been known since 1953 (different EEGs since 1937), but its deep significance has only been discovered and confirmed in very recent years (as explained below). Following are the key areas of breakthrough in sleep and dreams (from Patrick). Patrick states that these are HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025191 now reproducible, non-controversial, and well-accepted among experts, although still not appreciated by the public - hence the high value of our CTT TV series. The organizing idea is why and how are sleep and dreams essential for normal memory consolidation and bodily health / well-being. Memory Consolidation. There is a fundamental difference between REM and NREM Sleep for memory consolidation: REM is for emotional memories, whereas NREM is for declarative and procedural memories. Hence, understanding and dealing with REM emotional memories can lead to treatment for the many neuropsychiatric illnesses that have sleep/dream-related disorders or syndromes (Parkinson's Disease, Anxiety, Substance Abuse, many sleep disorders such as Nightmare Disorder, etc., in addition to PTSD and Depression). Research shows bi-directional causality between neuropsychiatric disorders and sleep disorders. This is a superb example of how fundamental science breakthroughs lead to clinical breakthroughs. This fact that REM is associated with emotional memories is nicely consistent with the apparent psychotic nature of dreams, because in REM Sleep the frontal cortex is 'down-regulated' (and the frontal cortex is associated with rational planning, reflection, controlling impulses), while in REM Sleep the limbic system is 'up-regulated\" (and the limbic system is associated with emotions and feelings) — see Neuroimaging below. This is why dream states flood the ego with emotional fantasies without rational control. However, it is also true that the limbic system enables creative ideas, thus grounding in science the long-suspected idea that sleep and dreams can enhance creativity. As Dr. Robert Stickgold, our other advisor on the series, wrote: \"It would be nice if we could talk about sleep and memory as if there were only one type of memory and one type of sleep. But this is far from the case. Sleep and memory each comes in many forms, and furthermore, memories can go through multiple forms of post-encoding processing that must be individually addressed.\" Immunity / Immune System. Strengthening the immune system is now a proven product of NREM sleep. Discerning the evolutionary basis for this is a key research project (i.e., it seems counter-intuitive that sleeping facilitates fitness for survival in that predators lurked in the jungles and on the plains so that going unconscious during sleep does not, at first glance, seem especially adaptive). Studies of sleep in various non-human animals reveals a direct relationship between longer periods of NREM (Slow-Wave) Sleep and a stronger immune system, especially in fighting parasites.

Neuroplasticity. Exciting recent research has reversed the century-long conventional wisdom that new neurons are never created in adult animals/humans. The development of new neurons — neuronogenesis — is a vital part of maintaining normal brain and mental functioning. New neurons are being created, importantly, in the hippocampus (brain organ where new memories are encoded) — but, remarkably, the neuronogensis in the hippocampus occurs only/largely during REM Sleep — a stunning finding. This is another reason why REM sleep is needed for emotional memory consolidation (normal functioning). Dream-Content. Although dreams have sparked human fascination and fantasy for thousands of years, only in very recent years, have large-scale surveys been conducted with rigorous design, classifications and statistical analysis. Literally hundreds of thousands of dreams are enabling statistically significant theories, including cross-cultural analyses (similarities and differences). Dream-posting sites have revolutionized size and structure of dream data sets. This enables, for the first time, longitudinal studies of dreams over time. Patterns are repeated. For example, in general, the dreams of males and females differ in fundamental ways. Males will engage in fighting with other males; females with both males and females. Male dreamers are often the initiator of fights and the fights are usually physical. Females fight verbally. Aggressiveness by the dreamer is almost always in REM Sleep, rarely in NREM Sleep. (Why is a continuing question.) \"Lucid Dreaming\" is a new area of fascinating research. Lucid Dreaming is where the dreamer \"knows\" that HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025192 he/she is dreaming while dreaming (a talent that a small minority possesses but more can be trained/developed). Lucid dreamers, while sleeping, can now communicate with experimenters by altering their brain activity and thus becoming detectable by neuroimaging techniques (see below). Neuroimaging. Finally, neuroimaging technology has enabled many of these breakthroughs. As such, it is itself a methodological breakthrough that has enabled these other content breakthroughs. Neuroimaging now enables detailed location of the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of REM and NREM Sleep. In REM Sleep, the dorsolateral, frontal cortex is \"down-regulated\", whereas the limbic system is \"up-regulated\", showing the physiological basis for the emotional, wild-fantasies of dreams (see above). (Neuroimaging will enable good visual images for the TV series without extra costs.) Patrick stresses that while these breakthroughs form, for the first time, a solid foundation for understanding sleep and dreams, they also open opportunities to dig deeper into the \"purpose\" of sleep and dreams, as well as engender a new series of questions and directions (e.g., clinical treatments of illnesses). Attached is Patrick's quick compiling of summaries of a few recent leading research papers (2009 — 2017, especially 2015-2017). You'd enjoy speaking with him, if you want.

Attached and below the same. Dear Jeffrey: As requested, the following addresses your two questions / concerns about our proposed Closer To Truth TV series \"The Science of Sleep and Dreams\": (i) Have there been sufficient breakthroughs in Sleep and Dreams (significantly beyond traditional understandings) to justify a major TV series? (ii) Even if 'yes' to (i), is now the proper time for such a foundational series, or are more years needed for corroborative studies and further research to solidify the breakthroughs? In preparing this response, my primary source is Professor Patrick McNamara, Department of Neurology, Boston University School of Medicine, with whom CTT Producer/Director Peter Getzels and I spoke with at length today. Patrick is one of the leading sleep and dream researchers (he himself more dreams). More importantly, he is perhaps the leading chronicler of the field, with many publications (including 26 entries in related encyclopedias). He is co-editor-in-chief of the \"Encyclopedia of Sleep and Dreams\" (2012) and the sole author of the forthcoming \"An Introduction to the Neuroscience of Sleep and Dreams\" (Cambridge University Press, 2018), which intends to present the latest science and to become a main textbook for graduate courses/seminars. Patrick is a CTT contributor and colleague. When we asked Patrick, his first response — \"This is the ideal time to tell the sleep-and-dreams story\" — and he cited (in essence) your two questions, in that (i) the multiple breakthroughs are now sufficiently well corroborated by numerous independent labs such that a substantial foundation for the new, deeper understanding of sleep and dreams is now for the first time (over the past few years) confirmed and established, and (ii) there are now interesting application and critical clinical questions to pose, explore and pursue, such as for the treatment of various mental-related illnesses that have known sleep-related syndromes (e.g., PTSD and Depression). To understand the significance of recent breakthroughs, a defining characteristic of sleep and dreams is that there are two distinct kinds of sleep — REM (rapid-eye-movement) Sleep and NREM (non-rapid-eye- movement) Sleep. Most dreams are associated with REM sleep (though complex). The eye movement gives the eponymous name, but a more important designation defines the two stages in terms of brain waves (electroencephalograph — EEG): REM is Fast-Wave Sleep (similar to the waking state) and NREM Sleep is Slow-Wave Sleep (very different from the waking state). This difference between REM and NREM sleep has been known since 1953 (different EEGs since 1937), but its deep significance has only been discovered and confirmed in very recent years (as explained below). Following are the key areas of breakthrough in sleep and dreams (from Patrick). Patrick states that these are HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025191 now reproducible, non-controversial, and well-accepted among experts, although still not appreciated by the public - hence the high value of our CTT TV series. The organizing idea is why and how are sleep and dreams essential for normal memory consolidation and bodily health / well-being. Memory Consolidation. There is a fundamental difference between REM and NREM Sleep for memory consolidation: REM is for emotional memories, whereas NREM is for declarative and procedural memories. Hence, understanding and dealing with REM emotional memories can lead to treatment for the many neuropsychiatric illnesses that have sleep/dream-related disorders or syndromes (Parkinson's Disease, Anxiety, Substance Abuse, many sleep disorders such as Nightmare Disorder, etc., in addition to PTSD and Depression). Research shows bi-directional causality between neuropsychiatric disorders and sleep disorders. This is a superb example of how fundamental science breakthroughs lead to clinical breakthroughs. This fact that REM is associated with emotional memories is nicely consistent with the apparent psychotic nature of dreams, because in REM Sleep the frontal cortex is 'down-regulated' (and the frontal cortex is associated with rational planning, reflection, controlling impulses), while in REM Sleep the limbic system is 'up-regulated\" (and the limbic system is associated with emotions and feelings) — see Neuroimaging below. This is why dream states flood the ego with emotional fantasies without rational control. However, it is also true that the limbic system enables creative ideas, thus grounding in science the long-suspected idea that sleep and dreams can enhance creativity. As Dr. Robert Stickgold, our other advisor on the series, wrote: \"It would be nice if we could talk about sleep and memory as if there were only one type of memory and one type of sleep. But this is far from the case. Sleep and memory each comes in many forms, and furthermore, memories can go through multiple forms of post-encoding processing that must be individually addressed.\" Immunity / Immune System. Strengthening the immune system is now a proven product of NREM sleep. Discerning the evolutionary basis for this is a key research project (i.e., it seems counter-intuitive that sleeping facilitates fitness for survival in that predators lurked in the jungles and on the plains so that going unconscious during sleep does not, at first glance, seem especially adaptive). Studies of sleep in various non-human animals reveals a direct relationship between longer periods of NREM (Slow-Wave) Sleep and a stronger immune system, especially in fighting parasites. NREM Sleep releases molecules that fight inflection; NREM Sleep works for the maintenance, repair and activation of the immune system. (This gives scientific rationale for the need or desire to sleep during illnesses.) Related are \"genetic conflict\" studies with respect to REM and NREM, showing differences in heredity between material and paternal lines, and differences between males and females in which genes get \"imprinted\".

Arianna and Mary find consensus that, contrary to the Washington and media conventional wisdom, the Jobs Agenda is more urgent than the Deficit Agenda (\"if people only read about shark attacks, they'll worry about shark attacks,\" says Arianna). And they agree that there's an apparent outbreak of men abusing the help -- Strauss-Kahn, Schwarzenegger, Ensign. To paraphase Freud, what do men want? But there's sharp disagreement about whether Rep. Ryan walked into Obama's trap by proposing to end Medicare in 10 years.

Is the money that authoritarians allocate for image beautification well spent? Some campaigns have been more successful than others, but autocracies that hire well-known former cabinet secretaries or elected officials to defend or deny their acts of repression often fail to sway either the public or the policy community in the United States. If democratic leaders have not mounted adequate responses to such repression, it is that the regime in question is benevolent and just. Authoritarian efforts to change governments, as opposed to perceptions, may ultimately prove more rewarding. Russias wager on the rise of friendly European populist parties already seems to be paying off. After Britain's vote to withdraw from the EU and the triumph of Donald Trump in the United States, the prospect of radical shifts in global politics can no longer be dismissed as unthinkable. 1.

We also urge more intense coverage of Beijing's efforts to undermine democratic norms in neighboring states or territories, as in Hong Kong and Taiwan, and its largely successful attempts to pressure other govern- ments into repatriating citizens who had fled persecu- tion in China. Lastly, the media are not doing their job if they neglect to give aggressive coverage to the lobbyists and pub- lic-relations specialists who make money by repre- senting dictators and kleptocrats. Those who flack for the leaders of China, Azerbaijan, Egypt, and their ilk should be made to answer for each political prisoner, murdered opposition figure, shuttered newspaper, and offshore account full of stolen funds that can be tied to their authoritarian clients. To the academic community: We urge academic associations, individual scholars, and university administrations to stand up for freedom of thought and open inquiry at a time when those values are under relentless pressure from dictatorships. We urge statements of protest against the persecution of fellow scholars or the politicized rewriting of history, especially in countries, like Russia and China, that are integrated into the international university system. We urge universities to reject the establishment of projects and study departments—whether at home or overseas—that do not adhere to the highest stan- dards of intellectual freedom or that restrict discus- sion of certain subjects. To the business community: We urge private busi- nesses to avoid commercial relationships with authoritarian governments that force them to violate fundamental democratic principles. Private compa- nies and investors have a clear interest in democratic public goods like the rule of law, which guarantees their property rights, and the transparency provid- ed by free media and corruption watchdogs, which ensures the accuracy of economic data and the fair allocation of state contracts. They should therefore do what they can to prevent any further deterioration in the condition of global democracy. Some sectors are especially vulnerable to authoritarian pressure, and have a special role to play in combating it. We urge the film industry to reject involvement in joint ventures with companies that have close ties to au- thoritarian regimes and reputations for demanding po- liticized censorship of artistic content. We also urge the technology industry to refuse business arrangements that require active complicity in or passive acceptance of political censorship or information control. To the European Union: We urge the EU to undertake a comprehensive review of member states’ democrat- ic institutions to determine whether recent changes have weakened checks and balances or unduly protected incumbent parties from fair electoral com- petition. The EU should adopt measures to publicize departures from democratic standards and develop a new set of sanctions that could be imposed on noncompliant governments—whether inside, outside, or hoping to join the bloc—even in the absence of unanimity among member states. In the meantime, the EU should use the sanctions already in place, even if it means freezing a member state's participation, and be prepared to actually impose any new sanctions that might be introduced. To private foundations: We urge private foundations to recognize and oppose the current assault on democracy. With a few exceptions, the great institu- tions of American philanthropy have studiously—and shamefully—ignored the steady erosion of global free- dom and the rise of authoritarian powers. The recent developments in Europe and the United States will hopefully shake their complacency. There is a strong need for analysis, support for individual dissidents, and aid for societies under authoritarian threat, and as many democratic governments waver in their com- mitment to such priorities, it is essential for private funders to step into the breach. To mainstream political candidates: We urge re- sponsible political figures to call out colleagues or rivals when they show contempt for basic democratic ideas. Until now, politicians in the democracies have been unimpressive in their responses to opponents who embrace authoritarian figures like Putin. This is despite the overwhelming evidence of egregious crimes under Putin’ rule: murdered journalists and political opposition leaders, the invasion of neighbor- ing states, brutish counterinsurgency campaigns in the North Caucasus, the emasculation of a once-vi- brant media sector, rigged elections, and much more. If they choose to shower him with praise, political leaders like Marine Le Pen, Geert Wilders, and Donald Trump should be forced to account for the realities of Putin's appalling record. The same is true for any politi- cian who praises dictators in the Middle East, Asia, or Africa. 60 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019294", "metadata": {"source_filename": "IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019294.txt", "parent_doc_id": "IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019294.txt", "chunk_index": 0, "entities": ["Europe", "Putin’", "China Lastly", "HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019294", "Modern Authoritarians", "Putin This", "Some", "They", "Africa", "Hong Kong", "Russia", "Middle East Asia", "Taiwan", "Until", "European Union We", "United States", "Beijing's", "Marine Le Pen Geert Wilders", "American", "China", "Methods", "With", "North Caucasus", "The EU", "BREAKING DOWN DEMOCRACY Goals Strategies", "Private", "China Azerbaijan Egypt", "Putin's", "Donald Trump"]}}], "reference_answer": {"text": "DOWN DEMOCRACY: Goals, Strategies", "structured": null, "metadata": {}}}

Is the money that authoritarians allocate for image beautification well spent? Some campaigns have been more successful than others, but autocracies that hire well-known former cabinet secretaries or elected officials to defend or deny their acts of repression often fail to sway either the public or the policy community in the United States. If democratic leaders have not mounted adequate responses to such repression, it is that the regime in question is benevolent and just. Authoritarian efforts to change governments, as opposed to perceptions, may ultimately prove more rewarding. Russias wager on the rise of friendly European populist parties already seems to be paying off. After Britain's vote to withdraw from the EU and the triumph of Donald Trump in the United States, the prospect of radical shifts in global politics can no longer be dismissed as unthinkable. 1.

We also urge more intense coverage of Beijing's efforts to undermine democratic norms in neighboring states or territories, as in Hong Kong and Taiwan, and its largely successful attempts to pressure other govern- ments into repatriating citizens who had fled persecu- tion in China. Lastly, the media are not doing their job if they neglect to give aggressive coverage to the lobbyists and pub- lic-relations specialists who make money by repre- senting dictators and kleptocrats. Those who flack for the leaders of China, Azerbaijan, Egypt, and their ilk should be made to answer for each political prisoner, murdered opposition figure, shuttered newspaper, and offshore account full of stolen funds that can be tied to their authoritarian clients. To the academic community: We urge academic associations, individual scholars, and university administrations to stand up for freedom of thought and open inquiry at a time when those values are under relentless pressure from dictatorships. We urge statements of protest against the persecution of fellow scholars or the politicized rewriting of history, especially in countries, like Russia and China, that are integrated into the international university system. We urge universities to reject the establishment of projects and study departments—whether at home or overseas—that do not adhere to the highest stan- dards of intellectual freedom or that restrict discus- sion of certain subjects. To the business community: We urge private busi- nesses to avoid commercial relationships with authoritarian governments that force them to violate fundamental democratic principles. Private compa- nies and investors have a clear interest in democratic public goods like the rule of law, which guarantees their property rights, and the transparency provid- ed by free media and corruption watchdogs, which ensures the accuracy of economic data and the fair allocation of state contracts. They should therefore do what they can to prevent any further deterioration in the condition of global democracy. Some sectors are especially vulnerable to authoritarian pressure, and have a special role to play in combating it. We urge the film industry to reject involvement in joint ventures with companies that have close ties to au- thoritarian regimes and reputations for demanding po- liticized censorship of artistic content.

This means a small teaching load since the best professors teach the least. Three semester-long courses in a year is a light load at a big state university. You might wonder, as an outsider to the ins and outs of the uni- versity, why the best professors teach the least. You also might wonder why I knew the types of courses he would teach and what I mean by that. I will explain. To start this explanation, it is important to understand why pro- fessors are “rewarded” with light teaching loads. (Note the word load. This is the normal way this is discussed in a university.) I was given an extraordinarily light load at Northwestern for two reasons. One reason was that universities, like baseball teams, recruit so-called “su- perstars” (yes, that is how they are referred to in the university) from competitors. So Northwestern had to beat Yale’s offer in my case. At Yale I taught one semester-long course per year, so Northwestern sim- ply made me a better offer. The reason both of these universities would even consider such a light load is that I earned money for the university.

I think you can see that North- western didn’t really care what I taught or when I taught it. They wanted that money. And, they also wanted the prestige. Before I go too much further, I need to explain the prestige thing because it is very important. In fact, the prestige issue for professors and universities is precisely the root of the problem in our education system. This will take some time to explain, so let me start simply for now. When Harvard plays Yale in football, they are battling for prestige. But the battle may not be on the field exactly. The real battle is in how powerful and important the alumni who attend the game have become and how big their respective endowments have become and who has the best chemistry department or business school. It is a real battle. The battle is for reputation. And, although it may seem silly to take this battle seriously, it is taken very seriously.

The real battle is in how powerful and important the alumni who attend the game have become and how big their respective endowments have become and who has the best chemistry department or business school. It is a real battle. The battle is for reputation. And, although it may seem silly to take this battle seriously, it is taken very seriously.

National Accounts Overall It seems to me that national accounts are doing nothing wrong except in modeling the depreciation curve from misleading sales evidence.

[jeeyacation@gmail.com] Subject: Trump appears with mobster-affiliated felon at New Year's bash/Joe Cinque Importance: High Jeffrey --I thought you might be interested in this article-- Nick Trump appears with mobster-affiliated felon at New Year's bash President-elect Donald Trump rang in the new year together with Joseph \"Joey No Socks\" Cinque — a convicted felon with ties to notorious Gambino crime family boss John Gotti, a recently released video has revealed. Cinque can be seen in a video obtained by the Palm Beach Daily News , cheering loudly as a tuxedo-clad Trump runs through a number of campaign promises before the hundreds of guests attending the New Year's Eve bash the President-elect threw at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Saturday. \"The taxes are coming down, regulations are coming off, we're going to get rid of Obamacare,\" Trump can be heard saying as an exuberant Cinque stands next to him, pumping his fists into the air. Cinque's Sunday appearance with Trump might raise some eyebrows. Beyond a 1989 felony conviction for possessing nearly $100,000 worth of stolen artwork, Cinque \"used to be friends with John Gotti,\" according to a New York Magazine profile from 1995 .

Further, Saturday's Mar-a-Lago party was far from the first time Cinque cheered on for Trump. An Associated Press report from this spring showed that the American Academy of Hospitality Sciences, a company owned and operated by Cinque, has awarded more than a dozen of Trump's golf courses, hotels, casinos and private clubs with so-called \"Star Diamond\" awards \"of true excellence in hospitality.\" The same report also found that about half of the roughly 30 people listed as \"trustees\" to the company are Trump friends or business associates. Trump, meanwhile, was listed on the company's website as its \"ambassador extraordinaire,\" and he even appeared in a 2009 tribute video to Cinque in which he said, \"There's nobody like him. He's a special guy.\" But when asked by reporters about Cinque in May, Trump denied knowing anything about him or his criminal past. \"If a guy's going to give you an award, you take it,\" the President-elect said at the time. \"You don't tend to look up his whole life story.\" The Trump transition team did not immediately return a request for comment on how the President-elect knows Cinque or why they appeared together Saturday. While standing alongside Cinque, Trump also took a moment to address the terror attack that left scores of nightclub revelers in Istanbul dead over the weekend — and how the bloodbath somehow necessitates a Mexican border wall. \"We will build a wall, you know that.

The President-elect made building a wall along the country's southern border one of his main campaign talking points, frequently promising his supporters that it will be a \"great\" and \"beautiful\" wall.

[jeeyacation@gmail.com] Subject: Trump appears with mobster-affiliated felon at New Year's bash/Joe Cinque Importance: High Jeffrey --I thought you might be interested in this article-- Nick Trump appears with mobster-affiliated felon at New Year's bash President-elect Donald Trump rang in the new year together with Joseph \"Joey No Socks\" Cinque — a convicted felon with ties to notorious Gambino crime family boss John Gotti, a recently released video has revealed. Cinque can be seen in a video obtained by the Palm Beach Daily News , cheering loudly as a tuxedo-clad Trump runs through a number of campaign promises before the hundreds of guests attending the New Year's Eve bash the President-elect threw at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Saturday. \"The taxes are coming down, regulations are coming off, we're going to get rid of Obamacare,\" Trump can be heard saying as an exuberant Cinque stands next to him, pumping his fists into the air. Cinque's Sunday appearance with Trump might raise some eyebrows. Beyond a 1989 felony conviction for possessing nearly $100,000 worth of stolen artwork, Cinque \"used to be friends with John Gotti,\" according to a New York Magazine profile from 1995 . Cinque was also \"shot three times and left for dead\" in a 1980 incident that authorities described as \"a hit,\" according to the profile. Further, Saturday's Mar-a-Lago party was far from the first time Cinque cheered on for Trump. An Associated Press report from this spring showed that the American Academy of Hospitality Sciences, a company owned and operated by Cinque, has awarded more than a dozen of Trump's golf courses, hotels, casinos and private clubs with so-called \"Star Diamond\" awards \"of true excellence in hospitality.\" The same report also found that about half of the roughly 30 people listed as \"trustees\" to the company are Trump friends or business associates.

The 20 were chosen from hundreds of graduate students in the New Sensations Prize, a contest now in its fourth year, organised by Charles Saatchi's gallery and Channel 4. Their work is part of The House of the Nobleman, an exhibition of art borrowed from international collections that is being staged in an 18th-century mansion in Cornwall Terrace, Regent's Park, a stone's throw from the Frieze Art Fair. Four of the graduates were selected to receive £1,000 bursaries to develop a project for inclusion. They are: German Pablo Wendel, 30, whose degree work involved squatting in a derelict chip shop to which he built a staircase, later dismantled by Royal College of Art staff in a health and safety row; Katie Surridge, 25, and Russian Nika Neelova, 23, both Slade School graduates, and Ross M Brown, 24, who is still studying in Dundee.

An extraordinary assumption is uncertain information accepted as fact. If the assumption is found to be false as of the effective date of the appraisal, we reserve the right to modify our value conclusions. 1. The subject property has a fueling dock and four fuel storage tanks located on site; including three diesel and one gasoline. There were no signs of contamination during our inspection and we have assumed that there is no adverse environmental impact in connection with the existing fuel equipment used on the subject property. 2. The parking garage at the subject slightly encroaches on the neighboring property to the immediate northwest. This land is owned by the Government of the Virgin Islands and we have assumed that no claim will arise from the encroachments. 3. For this analysis, we have valued the going concern interest in the subject property and have allocated the value of the personal property from the value of the real property. We were provided with financial statments from ownership that indicates the depreciated book value of these assets. Itis beyond our scope to value these assets in use; therefore, we have assumed that the book values of teh personal property items shown in the statments provided by ownership are reasonably accurate for the purpose of this allocation exercise. The value conclusions are based on the following hypothetical conditions that may affect the assignment results. A hypothetical condition is a condition contrary to known fact on the effective date of the appraisal but is supposed for the purpose of analysis. 1. No hypothetical conditions were employed in this analysis. The opinions of value expressed in this report are based on estimates and forecasts that are prospective in nature and subject to considerable risk and uncertainty. Events may occur that could cause the performance of the property to differ materially from our estimates, such as changes in the economy, interest rates, capitalization rates, financial strength of tenants, and behavior of investors, lenders, and consumers. Additionally, our opinions and forecasts are based partly on data obtained from interviews and third party sources, which are not always completely reliable.

Here, she reports on the Hollywood glamour, excitement and social shenanigans, including celebrating with Colin Firth, Jesse Eisenberg, Elton John, Oprah Winfrey and many more. photographs by PATRICK MCMULLAN Qaddafi is hunkering down in Tripoli, giving press interviews, denying that rebels are taking over Eastern Libya. Oil prices are shooting up over one hundred dollars a barrel. The U.S. government is on the verge of a shutdown. These are not the topsecret opening lines of Aaron Sorkin’s new script, but the global headlines of a world spinning out of control as I head to Los Angeles like an overdressed lemming to attend the 83rd Academy Awards and attempt to make sense of artists thrust into combat. For the second year, nearly 6,000 Academy members have nominated 10 films and the battle seems to be pared down to 2. The beloved instant classic, The King’s Speech, marches into the arena as the frontrunner, but passionate supporters of the edgier (critics’ darling) The Social Network have not conceded. The ballots are counted, the party invites are out and still the feelings are raw. Nominees are exhausted from campaigning. Woody Allen and George Lucas tell me they are no longer members of the Academy because pitting artists against each other to determine the quality of their work is insane. They are right. My event and publicity company is considered Switzerland by the studios, as we help every filmmaker to present his work. However, this year, against my better judgment, I am somewhat emotionally sucked in. In 2005, I met the unknown 32-year-old English director Tom Hooper on his first film for HBO, Elizabeth I starring Helen Mirren. Helen later wins an Oscar for portraying Queen Elizabeth in The Queen. Queen Elizabeth is the daughter of King George VI, portrayed by Oscar-winner Colin Firth in The King’s Speech directed by Hooper. No degrees of separation. At the Telluride Film Festival, Tom Hooper bathed in the glory of a hysterical standing ovation alongside Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush at the very first public screening of that film. Two weeks later at The Toronto Film Festival, Harvey Weinstein stood with his filmmakers witnessing the same reaction. The film won The Audience Prize. Their strategy was to say nothing, do nothing. They have a possible Oscar winner—four out of five past Best Pictures have premiered in Toronto. Cut to New York City at the end of September. It’s opening night at The Film Society of Lincoln Center. One of America’s most important and prolific producers, Scott Rudin, along with Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Aaron Sorkin, are in a brightly lit box waving down to their equally hysterical audience who have just seen The Social Network. The film opens the next day to rave reviews and endless publicity. David Fincher is off making The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Aaron Sorkin becomes the face of the film and an immediate shoo-in for the adapted screenplay Oscar. The Hamptons International Film Festival in October suddenly becomes a launching pad for 127 Hours, where star-cum-Yale/NYU student James Franco appears. More Oscar buzz. Producer/director Danny Boyle (Oscar winner for Slumdog Millionaire) stays in London all fall directing the play Frankenstein. Black Swan also unspools there in a tiny theater as Madonna, Alec Baldwin and Harvey Weinstein slip in the back. Darren Aronofsky is hailed a genius. Natalie Portman is instantly the hot nominee for Best Actress. Both films are sensations, but it’s The King’s Speech that wins The Audience Prize. Mid-November: David O. Russell and Mark Wahlberg sneak The Fighter in Manhattan. As their audience erupts in cheers, I tell producer/actor Wahlberg, “Clint Eastwood is going to kill himself for not directing this.” He says, “You’re wrong. He turned it down because he’s done it. He’s seen it and he loves it.” David O. Russell becomes my new Clint Eastwood. Christian Bale and Melissa Leo are hailed the supporting actors to beat. True Grit, directed by the Coen Brothers and also produced by Scott Rudin, finally throws its cowboy hat in the ring in mid-December at the Ziegfeld as the last serious Oscar contender for Best Picture. It gallops off to box office gold. The Social Network now cements its battle cry with one word: relevance. Mark Zuckerberg lands on the cover of Time Magazine as “Person of the Year.” A smart and extensive ad campaign positions the film in the lead. Critics and pundits proclaim the race is over. Everyone goes on holiday. This is one of the few times in Harvey Weinstein’s life that he’s caught off guard. He quickly mobilizes an inner team of 15 and conducts strategy meetings 7 days a week, including Christmas. They’re like a Chinese restaurant: always open. He sends screenwriter David Seidler and Tom Hooper to every corner of the country doing Q&As until they are both blue in the face from “finding their voice.” SAG voters begin seeing the film two and three times. In January at the Golden Globes, about 88 foreign journalists give awards to The Social Network for Best Drama, Director and Screenplay. The film is still perceived as the Oscar winner and nobody can stop the steamroller. Only Academy voters disregard these awards. The King’s Speech wins the PGA in L.A. Everyone is totally surprised when Tom Hooper goes on to win the DGA. After a tremendous amount of hard work by team Weinstein, the actors win for the SAG Ensemble. The BAFTAs reinforced their lead; the film is now the frontrunner. It takes the media a few weeks to catch on. Emma Stone Collin Firth and Anne Hathaway Gwyneth Paltrow Sandra Bullock Tom Hooper Carolina Herrera Jennifer Lawrence Marisa Tomei Leslie Mann and Judd Apatow Melissa Leo Steve Martin Steven Tyler and Liv Tyler George Hamilton and Kimberly Blackford Kevin Spacey L’Wren Scott and Mick Jagger I whisper to Harrison [Ford], “That looks just like Johnny Depp.” Harrison rolls his eyes and reluctantly introduces me to his friend . . . Johnny Depp. The Daily Mail announces Her Royal Highness Queen Elizabeth has enjoyed a private screening of The King’s Speech and is “moved” by the film. With no proof the Queen has actually seen the film, press agents send out a global press release thanking her Majesty for the endorsement. FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 24 Mid-day, I arrive at The Beverly Hills Hotel. As the housekeepers unpack my bags upstairs I peek into the Polo Lounge and find Warren Beatty in a booth. I tell him I’m rooting for his wife, Annette Benning, and love her film, The Kids Are All Right. Warren says The Social Network will win. This year I am two days late arriving to Oscar weekend. I am shown to a very, very small room—the size of a broom closet. Uncharacteristically, I have a slight melt down. I am moved. The housekeepers run down the hall with my clothes flying. The hotel is sold out, so I get someone else’s room. Another unsuspecting victim checking in downstairs will get the broom closet. It is cold, grey and rainy. Taffeta, organdy and embroidered silk evening clothes hang in my closet. I stay in my sweaters and fur coat, and head to Arianna Huffington’s home in Beverly Hills where she and Wendi Murdoch are hosting a party for Tom Freston’s wife, the beautiful, blonde Kathy. Her book is called Veganist: Lose Weight, Get Healthy, Change the World—perfect for monks. Arianna has just sold the Huffington Post to AOL for $315 million dollars and is rumored to have personally landed around $20 million. She is euphoric as she greets Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban at the door. Other drenched power players include Disney’s Bob Iger and wife Willow Bay,Fox’s Jim Gianopulos, Candice Bergen and journalist daughter Chloe Malle, Google’s Eric Schmidt, Oliver Stone escorting his daughter Tara and avoiding questions about Charlie Sheen, Moby, Jamie Niven, Brian Grazer, Vivi Nevo, CBS’s Les Moonves and Julie Chen, Rob Reiner, Paramount’s Brad Grey and fiancé Cassandra Huysentruyt and Jeff Bezos. Hors d’oeuvres include pigs in blankets—a food group not mentioned in Kathy’s book. The action migrates to UTA Jim Burkus’ home for a party for True Grit’s Ethan and Joel Coen. I pass Ron Howard on the way in and he says, “Keep me on your list.” Is he kidding? Sunrise and Mark Ruffalo, Focus Feature’s James Shamus, Nancy Meyers and John Goldwyn mingle. Adorable Hallie Steinfeld is there with her parents. I am trying to fix her up with Justin Bieber. She giggles, “Peg, I am only 14.” I am face to face with Harrison Ford and stupidly tell him I love him in Morning Glory. He’s looking at me in utter disbelief, but I will not shut up. A gorgeous guy is inches away in a hat and glasses. I whisper to Harrison, “That looks just like Johnny Depp.” Harrison rolls his eyes and reluctantly introduces me to his friend . . . Johnny Depp. I babble a bit about his great work then run for cover in a corner next to my buddy, Jerry Bruckheimer. I head over to the CAA/Bryan Lourd’s “Friday Night Party.” Torrential rains and horrific winds cause a traffic jam that makes it impossible to get near the house. The world’s most famous faces cower under black umbrellas and make a run for it. Bryan Lourd and Bruce Bozzi receive friends at the door all night. Inside, Uma Thurman tells me she finally moved into a doorman building in New York after being terrorized by stalkers for years. Ben Walker talks about Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, which he is about to shoot, while his fiancé, Mamie Gummer, looks sexy shivering in a white satin gown. Producer Jon Kilik mentions he oversaw a new cut of Julian Schnabel’s Miral, to be released in March. Bennett Miller, standing with Kristin Gore, says Sony loves his new film, Moneyball, and Brad Pitt is terrific. (When is Brad Pitt not terrific?) Sandy Gallin tells me he has an actual job decorating Jeffrey Katzenberg’s home. I congratulate Barry Levinson’s son Sam, a director, for winning the writing award at Sundance for his first film, Another Happy Day. Also seen floating around are Taylor Swift and Jake Gyllenhaal—but not together—Sean Penn, Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, Anderson Cooper, Hilary Swank, Kelly Ripa, Paul Haggis, Marisa Tomei, Kate Beckinsale, Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher, Kate Hudson, Gerard Butler, Renee Zellweger with Bradley Cooper, Biutiful director Alejandro Gonzalez-Inarritu, Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal, Ellen Barkin (who is headed to Broadway in The Normal Heart this spring) and CAA’s Kevin Huvane, Richard Lovett and Hylda Queally. Sony Classic’s Michael Barker tells me The Social Network will win. Tired celebs try to go home, but limo lock is at a standstill. Cell phones don’t work in the area. Two hundred swells become party prisoners and happily hang out till 5 a.m. SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 26 Out comes the sun and dries up all the rain. IAC chairmen and owner of Newsweek/The Daily Beast Barry Diller and his wife Diane Von Furstenberg (with her kids Alex and Tatiana) host their 15th annual lunch for Graydon Carter in their Coldwater Canyon home. Barry introduces me to his star guest, Gov. Jerry Brown, just elected to his third (nonconsecutive) term as California governor. Like last year, enormous clear plastic tents are erected on the hill near the house. Long wooden picnic tables sit on oriental rugs covering the soggy ground. VIPs wears winter clothes, comfy sweaters and sensible shoes. I arrive in a fur coat. Stephen Gaghan and Minnie Mortimer Scarlett Johansson Charlize Theron Lourdes Leon and Madonna Armie Hammer Kate Beckinsale Aaron Sorkin Georgina Chapman Hilary Swank Cameron Diaz Wendi Murdoch, Kathy Freston and Arianna Huffington Natalie Portman Brian Grazer and Jeff Bezos Tom Ford Everybody knows everybody, and it doesn’t matter if you have a hit film or T.V. show this season. Oprah Winfrey kisses David Geffen, casually chats with former Disney C.E.O. Michael Eisner and current Sony Chief Sir Howard Stringer and Rob Weisenthal. Brett Ratner arrives with his houseguest Jean Pigozzi, who is allowed to take photographs. Graydon greets people with chic wife Anna by his side. Ingrid Sischy and Sandy Brant, Rupert Murdoch, Ron Meyer, Francesco Clemente with his twin boys and Tom Ford chat each other up. People to watch include pregnant Victoria and David Beckham with Lynn Wyatt, Fran Lebowitz, Larry Gagosian and Shala Monroque, Ben Silverman, Debbie and Allen I head over to the CAA/Bryan Lourd’s “Friday Night Party.” Torrential rains and horrific winds cause a traffic jam that makes it impossible to get near the house. The world’s most famous faces cower under black umbrellas and make a run for it. Grubman, Sotheby’s Tobias Meyer and Mark Fletcher and Stephen Gaghan and Mini Mortimer wearing her oversized cat glasses. Bruce Cohen has invited me to the Oscar broadcast rehearsal. Inside the Kodak Theater’s massive auditorium, I find a seat next to his proud parents. I watch Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem come out in white dinner jackets and flub their lines as they pretend to present Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Original Screenplay. Josh will later tell me that their acting methods are completely opposite: he’s a quick study and is very creative and comfortable ad-libbing; Javier, whose mother tongue is Spanish, likes to have every syllable printed out to study with a dialect coach. Life-size photos on cardboard plaques are taped to each nominee’s chair. I memorize their location so when I return Sunday I can quickly kiss them all. Back at the Beverly Hills hotel I slip into my black tulle Dennis Basso cocktail dress with a plunging neckline and put on my mother’s jewels. Jim Coleman takes me to the “Night Before Party” in the hotel. This is Jeffrey Katzenberg’s 9th annual A-lister event benefiting The Motion Picture & Television Fund where they raise $6.5 million dollars in 1 night. I walk into Valentino, who gives me an approving once-over. I tell him and Giancarlo Giammetti that Woody Allen’s new film, Midnight in Paris, is opening the Cannes Film Festival and they must bring the yacht. Elton John and David Furnish join our conversation so of course we ask for intimate details about baby Zachary. I segue over to Amy Adams, who, like them, mentions she hates leaving her baby in the hotel room. Next stop is Kate Capshaw in a black bowler hat chatting with Steven Spielberg’s god-daughter, Gwyneth Paltrow. I have known Steven for years (in 1982 I was a publicist on E.T.). I now tell him I’m going to the Lincoln Center opening of War Horse with Kathy Kennedy and Frank Marshall and cannot wait to see his movie version. I meet sweet Jennifer Aniston, her new haircut and her perfect little body. Her date tells me her secret is a half-hour on the treadmill everyday—such an understatement. I tell Jesse Eisenberg I was on his plane home from the Baftas last week, but he was hiding under his hoodie. He says innocently, “You should have said ‘hello.’ I always cover my head because I think my curls make me look like a girl.” The charity gives us a coupon booklet redeemable at various booths. Rich people run around like lunatics, collecting gifts for their housekeepers. Among the shoppers are Steven and Heather Mnuchin, Viacom’s Deborah and Philippe Dauman, Tamara Mellon, Christine Taylor and Ben Stiller, Cate Blanchet, Susan and Robert Downey Jr. and Debra and Hugh Jackman. Next stop is The Weinstein Company’s party at the Soho House sponsored by MontBlanc. Long gone are the funky Miramax Saturday night soirees where nominees spoofed their own films in homemade costumes and ad-libbed hilarious skits. No more grown men dressed as Anna Paquin playing the piano in hopes of winning a Max Award. As I come in, a 400-pound gorilla refuses to let me on the elevator. Once on, I see Jennifer Lopez in the corner and remind her we met on Len Blavatnik’s yacht in Cannes. She graciously pretends to remember me. Her manager, Benny Medina, is kicking me. I slip into Colin Firth’s booth to have a tête-à-tête with him and his wife Livia Giuggioli. Jokingly, I suggest he say “I’m speechless” when he wins. Colin patiently assures me many people, far more clever than I, thought of this. He then says that others are waging bets on whether he might subconsciously stutter. I grill him about his wardrobe, assuming he will be wearing a new Tom Ford tuxedo. He tells me both he and Ford will be in older Ford models. I tell him I made rich-butthrifty Charles Ferguson, director of Inside Job, spend $6,000 dollars for a new Tom Ford tux. In the back room, Jennifer Lopez is now seated with Weinstein’s wife, Georgina Chapman. Helena Bonham Carter, her live-in-lover Tim Burton and her mother Elena circulate. Star power includes Adrien Brody, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Cameron Diaz, Camilla Belle, Chace Vera Farmiga Adrien Brody Andrew Garfield Oliver Stone and Tara Stone Claire Danes and Hugh Dancy Hailee Steinfeld Taylor Swift Donald and Melania Trump Donna Karan Lynn Wyatt Barry Diller Jon Hamm and Jennifer Westfeldt Anderson Cooper Chloe Malle and Candice Bergen Diane von Furstenberg Tory Burch Crawford, Claire Danes and Hugh Dancy, Darren Aronofsky, director John Wells, Kerry Washington, Piers Morgan, Rachel Zoe, Sean Parker, Zack Braff and Leonardo Dicaprio with Bar Rafaeli. Speech filmmakers are functioning on high anxiety. SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 27 Producer Donna Gigliotti is my date to the awards. We are both so nervous we arrive at the Kodak Theater at 3 p.m. and nobody is there. We are driven around for an hour. When we arrive back at the world’s most famous red carpet, I guide Donna through security check-in to the extreme right to make sure we get on camera. I teach her the red carpet hustle, which is five steps forward, three steps back, one inch behind a couture-clad nominee. We greet Kevin Huvane as Sandra Bullock is talking to ABC-TV and a billion people see me wearing a black Marchesa gown. Five steps forward, three steps back, we next meet Gwyneth Paltrow, and I hook up the back of her dress while another billion people see me correct the fashion malfunction. Five steps forward, three steps back, we’re now posing behind Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban. Our Blackberrys begin buzzing; the world has seen us. James Franco and Anne Hathaway are hip hosts. This is the year of no surprises. But it isn’t until Hilary Swank yells out Hooper’s name for Best Director that Harvey’s gang finally realizes they are getting the Oscar for Best Picture after all. Harvey is sitting in Spielberg’s seat as Spielberg announces the win from the stage. Producers Iain Canning, Emile Sherman and Gareth Unwin leap up and kiss each other.Six months of grueling work have finally paid off. King George VI and Harvey Weinstein now share the journey of a single man who triumphs over adversity. At the Governor’s ball, held above the Kodak Theater, the winners triumphantly sachet around the room holding their heavy eight-pound gold statues. An hour later there is a migration to the Vanity Fair party hosted by Graydon Carter at Jeff Klein’s Sunset Tower Hotel. The invitation features a gold hologram that transmits a radio frequency of a photo and details about the guest to VF staff as they arrive. The next day “Page Six” will report that the backup private security firm is run by a former Israeli operative, when in fact they are Irish Catholics from Staten Island. There’s a hierarchy of arrival times. At 5 p.m. the inner circle of Graydon’s 141 best friends attend a seated dinner. They include Barry Diller and Diane von Furstenberg, Francis Ford Coppola, Jon Hamm and Jennifer Westfeldt, Betsey Bloomingdale, Tory Burch and Lyor Cohen, Carolina and Reinaldo Herrera, L’Wren Scott and Sir Mick Jagger, Naomi Watts and Liev Schreiber, Wendi Stark, George Hamilton, Judd Apatow, Jackie and Joan Collins, Donna Karan and Steve Martin. The best and the brightest talent in town arrive at 9 p.m. Every single winner shows up. Also there are Justin Bieber and his date Selena Gomez, Michelle Williams, Emma Stone, Steve Tyler and Liv Tyler, Andrew Garfield, Jude Law, Armie Hammer, Vera Farmiga, Kevin Spacey, Charlize Theron, Anne Hathaway, Winter’s Bone star-of-tomorrow Jennifer Lawrence, Taylor Hackford and Helen Mirren, Scarlett Johansson, Isla Fischer and Sasha Baron Cohen, Tom Hanks, Sean Penn, Renee Zellweger and Bradley Cooper and Jane Fonda after her play, 33 Variations. I introduce Melania and Donald Trump to David O. Russell as The Trumpster gushes about The Fighter. David tells Donald he used to be a waiter/bar tender at many of Trump’s parties. Donald smiles as if looking at yet another apprentice. He then offers me a ride home on his plane; he’s leaving in 10 minutes. Too bad James Franco didn’t know because he is presently sitting on a commercial flight back to school, skipping his own after-party. The rest of the guests’ social standings are determined by half-hour increments. VF’s Beth Kseniak, Matt Ullian and Jane Sarkin tell me the list is cut down to 800 this year. At 11:30 p.m. there is another celebrity migration up the hill to Madonna manager Guy Oseary’s house. Earlier in the I introduce Melania and Donald Trump to David O. Russell . . . David tells Donald he used to be a waiter/bar tender at many of Trump’s parties. Donald smiles as if looking at yet another apprentice. evening, Madonna came down the hill to pose in a risqué see-thru outfit with daughter Lourdes. Madonna and co-host Demi Moore are able to lure the crème de la crème with the promise of dancing and no cameras. MONDAY, FEBRUARY 28 A winner’s work is never done. Colin Firth, Tom Hooper and David Seidler show up at 4:30 a.m. at The Four Seasons Hotel for a live broadcast on “The Today Show.” Functioning on an adrenalin rush, they return to the Kodak Theater with Geoffrey Rush to appear on Oprah’s live broadcast. By the end of this year’s thrilling race between two great producers—Scott Rudin and Harvey Weinstein— Facebook and Twitter are credited for aiding political justice from the streets of Cairo to Tripoli. But the British film with the most heart wins as one single human voice can still make a difference. The king has spoken. ✦ Fran Lebowitz Julie Chen Ellen Barkin Naomi Watts Joan Collins Chace Crawford", "metadata": {"source_filename": "TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012700.txt", "parent_doc_id":

An extraordinary assumption is uncertain information accepted as fact. If the assumption is found to be false as of the effective date of the appraisal, we reserve the right to modify our value conclusions. 1. The subject property has a fueling dock and four fuel storage tanks located on site; including three diesel and one gasoline. There were no signs of contamination during our inspection and we have assumed that there is no adverse environmental impact in connection with the existing fuel equipment used on the subject property. 2. The parking garage at the subject slightly encroaches on the neighboring property to the immediate northwest. This land is owned by the Government of the Virgin Islands and we have assumed that no claim will arise from the encroachments. 3. For this analysis, we have valued the going concern interest in the subject property and have allocated the value of the personal property from the value of the real property. We were provided with financial statments from ownership that indicates the depreciated book value of these assets. Itis beyond our scope to value these assets in use; therefore, we have assumed that the book values of teh personal property items shown in the statments provided by ownership are reasonably accurate for the purpose of this allocation exercise. The value conclusions are based on the following hypothetical conditions that may affect the assignment results. A hypothetical condition is a condition contrary to known fact on the effective date of the appraisal but is supposed for the purpose of analysis. 1. No hypothetical conditions were employed in this analysis. The opinions of value expressed in this report are based on estimates and forecasts that are prospective in nature and subject to considerable risk and uncertainty. Events may occur that could cause the performance of the property to differ materially from our estimates, such as changes in the economy, interest rates, capitalization rates, financial strength of tenants, and behavior of investors, lenders, and consumers. Additionally, our opinions and forecasts are based partly on data obtained from interviews and third party sources, which are not always completely reliable.

Oil prices are shooting up over one hundred dollars a barrel. The U.S. government is on the verge of a shutdown. These are not the topsecret opening lines of Aaron Sorkin’s new script, but the global headlines of a world spinning out of control as I head to Los Angeles like an overdressed lemming to attend the 83rd Academy Awards and attempt to make sense of artists thrust into combat. For the second year, nearly 6,000 Academy members have nominated 10 films and the battle seems to be pared down to 2. The beloved instant classic, The King’s Speech, marches into the arena as the frontrunner, but passionate supporters of the edgier (critics’ darling) The Social Network have not conceded. The ballots are counted, the party invites are out and still the feelings are raw. Nominees are exhausted from campaigning. Woody Allen and George Lucas tell me they are no longer members of the Academy because pitting artists against each other to determine the quality of their work is insane. They are right. My event and publicity company is considered Switzerland by the studios, as we help every filmmaker to present his work. However, this year, against my better judgment, I am somewhat emotionally sucked in. In 2005, I met the unknown 32-year-old English director Tom Hooper on his first film for HBO, Elizabeth I starring Helen Mirren. Helen later wins an Oscar for portraying Queen Elizabeth in The Queen. Queen Elizabeth is the daughter of King George VI, portrayed by Oscar-winner Colin Firth in The King’s Speech directed by Hooper. No degrees of separation. At the Telluride Film Festival, Tom Hooper bathed in the glory of a hysterical standing ovation alongside Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush at the very first public screening of that film. Two weeks later at The Toronto Film Festival, Harvey Weinstein stood with his filmmakers witnessing the same reaction. The film won The Audience Prize. Their strategy was to say nothing, do nothing. They have a possible Oscar winner—four out of five past Best Pictures have premiered in Toronto. Cut to New York City at the end of September. It’s opening night at The Film Society of Lincoln Center. One of America’s most important and prolific producers, Scott Rudin, along with Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Aaron Sorkin, are in a brightly lit box waving down to their equally hysterical audience who have just seen The Social Network. The film opens the next day to rave reviews and endless publicity. David Fincher is off making The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Aaron Sorkin becomes the face of the film and an immediate shoo-in for the adapted screenplay Oscar. The Hamptons International Film Festival in October suddenly becomes a launching pad for 127 Hours, where star-cum-Yale/NYU student James Franco appears. More Oscar buzz. Producer/director Danny Boyle (Oscar winner for Slumdog Millionaire) stays in London all fall directing the play Frankenstein. Black Swan also unspools there in a tiny theater as Madonna, Alec Baldwin and Harvey Weinstein slip in the back. Darren Aronofsky is hailed a genius. Natalie Portman is instantly the hot nominee for Best Actress. Both films are sensations, but it’s The King’s Speech that wins The Audience Prize. Mid-November: David O. Russell and Mark Wahlberg sneak The Fighter in Manhattan. As their audience erupts in cheers, I tell producer/actor Wahlberg, “Clint Eastwood is going to kill himself for not directing this.” He says, “You’re wrong. He turned it down because he’s done it. He’s seen it and he loves it.” David O. Russell becomes my new Clint Eastwood. Christian Bale and Melissa Leo are hailed the supporting actors to beat. True Grit, directed by the Coen Brothers and also produced by Scott Rudin, finally throws its cowboy hat in the ring in mid-December at the Ziegfeld as the last serious Oscar contender for Best Picture. It gallops off to box office gold. The Social Network now cements its battle cry with one word: relevance. Mark Zuckerberg lands on the cover of Time Magazine as “Person of the Year.” A smart and extensive ad campaign positions the film in the lead. Critics and pundits proclaim the race is over. Everyone goes on holiday. This is one of the few times in Harvey Weinstein’s life that he’s caught off guard. He quickly mobilizes an inner team of 15 and conducts strategy meetings 7 days a week, including Christmas. They’re like a Chinese restaurant: always open. He sends screenwriter David Seidler and Tom Hooper to every corner of the country doing Q&As until they are both blue in the face from “finding their voice.” SAG voters begin seeing the film two and three times. In January at the Golden Globes, about 88 foreign journalists give awards to The Social Network for Best Drama, Director and Screenplay. The film is still perceived as the Oscar winner and nobody can stop the steamroller. Only Academy voters disregard these awards. The King’s Speech wins the PGA in L.A. Everyone is totally surprised when Tom Hooper goes on to win the DGA. After a tremendous amount of hard work by team Weinstein, the actors win for the SAG Ensemble. The BAFTAs reinforced their lead; the film is now the frontrunner. It takes the media a few weeks to catch on.

Johnny Depp. The Daily Mail announces Her Royal Highness Queen Elizabeth has enjoyed a private screening of The King’s Speech and is “moved” by the film. With no proof the Queen has actually seen the film, press agents send out a global press release thanking her Majesty for the endorsement. FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 24 Mid-day, I arrive at The Beverly Hills Hotel. As the housekeepers unpack my bags upstairs I peek into the Polo Lounge and find Warren Beatty in a booth. I tell him I’m rooting for his wife, Annette Benning, and love her film, The Kids Are All Right. Warren says The Social Network will win. This year I am two days late arriving to Oscar weekend. I am shown to a very, very small room—the size of a broom closet. Uncharacteristically, I have a slight melt down. I am moved. The housekeepers run down the hall with my clothes flying. The hotel is sold out, so I get someone else’s room. Another unsuspecting victim checking in downstairs will get the broom closet. It is cold, grey and rainy. Taffeta, organdy and embroidered silk evening clothes hang in my closet. I stay in my sweaters and fur coat, and head to Arianna Huffington’s home in Beverly Hills where she and Wendi Murdoch are hosting a party for Tom Freston’s wife, the beautiful, blonde Kathy. Her book is called Veganist: Lose Weight, Get Healthy, Change the World—perfect for monks. Arianna has just sold the Huffington Post to AOL for $315 million dollars and is rumored to have personally landed around $20 million. She is euphoric as she greets Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban at the door. Other drenched power players include Disney’s Bob Iger and wife Willow Bay,Fox’s Jim Gianopulos, Candice Bergen and journalist daughter Chloe Malle, Google’s Eric Schmidt, Oliver Stone escorting his daughter Tara and avoiding questions about Charlie Sheen, Moby, Jamie Niven, Brian Grazer, Vivi Nevo, CBS’s Les Moonves and Julie Chen, Rob Reiner, Paramount’s Brad Grey and fiancé Cassandra Huysentruyt and Jeff Bezos. Hors d’oeuvres include pigs in blankets—a food group not mentioned in Kathy’s book. The action migrates to UTA Jim Burkus’ home for a party for True Grit’s Ethan and Joel Coen. I pass Ron Howard on the way in and he says, “Keep me on your list.” Is he kidding? Sunrise and Mark Ruffalo, Focus Feature’s James Shamus, Nancy Meyers and John Goldwyn mingle. Adorable Hallie Steinfeld is there with her parents. I am trying to fix her up with Justin Bieber. She giggles, “Peg, I am only 14.” I am face to face with Harrison Ford and stupidly tell him I love him in Morning Glory. He’s looking at me in utter disbelief, but I will not shut up. A gorgeous guy is inches away in a hat and glasses. I whisper to Harrison, “That looks just like Johnny Depp.” Harrison rolls his eyes and reluctantly introduces me to his friend . . . Johnny Depp. I babble a bit about his great work then run for cover in a corner next to my buddy, Jerry Bruckheimer. I head over to the CAA/Bryan Lourd’s “Friday Night Party.” Torrential rains and horrific winds cause a traffic jam that makes it impossible to get near the house. The world’s most famous faces cower under black umbrellas and make a run for it. Bryan Lourd and Bruce Bozzi receive friends at the door all night. Inside, Uma Thurman tells me she finally moved into a doorman building in New York after being terrorized by stalkers for years. Ben Walker talks about Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, which he is about to shoot, while his fiancé, Mamie Gummer, looks sexy shivering in a white satin gown. Producer Jon Kilik mentions he oversaw a new cut of Julian Schnabel’s Miral, to be released in March. Bennett Miller, standing with Kristin Gore, says Sony loves his new film, Moneyball, and Brad Pitt is terrific. (When is Brad Pitt not terrific?) Sandy Gallin tells me he has an actual job decorating Jeffrey Katzenberg’s home. I congratulate Barry Levinson’s son Sam, a director, for winning the writing award at Sundance for his first film, Another Happy Day. Also seen floating around are Taylor Swift and Jake Gyllenhaal—but not together—Sean Penn, Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, Anderson Cooper, Hilary Swank, Kelly Ripa, Paul Haggis, Marisa Tomei, Kate Beckinsale, Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher, Kate Hudson, Gerard Butler, Renee Zellweger with Bradley Cooper, Biutiful director Alejandro Gonzalez-Inarritu, Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal, Ellen Barkin (who is headed to Broadway in The Normal Heart this spring) and CAA’s Kevin Huvane, Richard Lovett and Hylda Queally. Sony Classic’s Michael Barker tells me The Social Network will win. Tired celebs try to go home, but limo lock is at a standstill. Cell phones don’t work in the area. Two hundred swells become party prisoners and happily hang out till 5 a.m. SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 26 Out comes the sun and dries up all the rain. IAC chairmen and owner of Newsweek/The Daily Beast Barry Diller and his wife Diane Von Furstenberg (with her kids Alex and Tatiana) host their 15th annual lunch for Graydon Carter in their Coldwater Canyon home. Barry introduces me to his star guest, Gov. Jerry Brown, just elected to his third (nonconsecutive) term as California governor. Like last year, enormous clear plastic tents are erected on the hill near the house. Long wooden picnic tables sit on oriental rugs covering the soggy ground. VIPs wears winter clothes, comfy sweaters and sensible shoes. I arrive in a fur coat. Stephen Gaghan and Minnie Mortimer Scarlett Johansson Charlize Theron Lourdes Leon and Madonna Armie Hammer Kate Beckinsale Aaron Sorkin Georgina Chapman Hilary Swank Cameron Diaz Wendi Murdoch, Kathy Freston and Arianna Huffington Natalie Portman Brian Grazer and Jeff Bezos Tom Ford Everybody knows everybody, and it doesn’t matter if you have a hit film or T.V. show this season. Oprah Winfrey kisses David Geffen, casually chats with former Disney C.E.O. Michael Eisner and current Sony Chief Sir Howard Stringer and Rob Weisenthal. Brett Ratner arrives with his houseguest Jean Pigozzi, who is allowed to take photographs. Graydon greets people with chic wife Anna by his side. Ingrid Sischy and Sandy Brant, Rupert Murdoch, Ron Meyer, Francesco Clemente with his twin boys and Tom Ford chat each other up. People to watch include pregnant Victoria and David Beckham with Lynn Wyatt, Fran Lebowitz, Larry Gagosian and Shala Monroque, Ben Silverman, Debbie and Allen I head over to the CAA/Bryan Lourd’s “Friday Night Party.” Torrential rains and horrific winds cause a traffic jam that makes it impossible to get near the house. The world’s most famous faces cower under black umbrellas and make a run for it. Grubman, Sotheby’s Tobias Meyer and Mark Fletcher and Stephen Gaghan and Mini Mortimer wearing her oversized cat glasses. Bruce Cohen has invited me to the Oscar broadcast rehearsal. Inside the Kodak Theater’s massive auditorium, I find a seat next to his proud parents. I watch Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem come out in white dinner jackets and flub their lines as they pretend to present Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Original Screenplay. Josh will later tell me that their acting methods are completely opposite: he’s a quick study and is very creative and comfortable ad-libbing; Javier, whose mother tongue is Spanish, likes to have every syllable printed out to study with a dialect coach. Life-size photos on cardboard plaques are taped to each nominee’s chair. I memorize their location so when I return Sunday I can quickly kiss them all. Back at the Beverly Hills hotel I slip into my black tulle Dennis Basso cocktail dress with a plunging neckline and put on my mother’s jewels. Jim Coleman takes me to the “Night Before Party” in the hotel. This is Jeffrey Katzenberg’s 9th annual A-lister event benefiting The Motion Picture & Television Fund where they raise $6.5 million dollars in 1 night. I walk into Valentino, who gives me an approving once-over. I tell him and Giancarlo Giammetti that Woody Allen’s new film, Midnight in Paris, is opening the Cannes Film Festival and they must bring the yacht. Elton John and David Furnish join our conversation so of course we ask for intimate details about baby Zachary. I segue over to Amy Adams, who, like them, mentions she hates leaving her baby in the hotel room. Next stop is Kate Capshaw in a black bowler hat chatting with Steven Spielberg’s god-daughter, Gwyneth Paltrow. I have known Steven for years (in 1982 I was a publicist on E.T.). I now tell him I’m going to the Lincoln Center opening of War Horse with Kathy Kennedy and Frank Marshall and cannot wait to see his movie version. I meet sweet Jennifer Aniston, her new haircut and her perfect little body. Her date tells me her secret is a half-hour on the treadmill everyday—such an understatement. I tell Jesse Eisenberg I was on his plane home from the Baftas last week, but he was hiding under his hoodie. He says innocently, “You should have said ‘hello.’ I always cover my head because I think my curls make me look like a girl.” The charity gives us a coupon booklet redeemable at various booths. Rich people run around like lunatics, collecting gifts for their housekeepers. Among the shoppers are Steven and Heather Mnuchin, Viacom’s Deborah and Philippe Dauman, Tamara Mellon, Christine Taylor and Ben Stiller, Cate Blanchet, Susan and Robert Downey Jr. and Debra and Hugh Jackman. Next stop is The Weinstein Company’s party at the Soho House sponsored by MontBlanc. Long gone are the funky Miramax Saturday night soirees where nominees spoofed their own films in homemade costumes and ad-libbed hilarious skits. No more grown men dressed as Anna Paquin playing the piano in hopes of winning a Max Award. As I come in, a 400-pound gorilla refuses to let me on the elevator. Once on, I see Jennifer Lopez in the corner and remind her we met on Len Blavatnik’s yacht in Cannes. She graciously pretends to remember me. Her manager, Benny Medina, is kicking me. I slip into Colin Firth’s booth to have a tête-à-tête with him and his wife Livia Giuggioli. Jokingly, I suggest he say “I’m speechless” when he wins. Colin patiently assures me many people, far more clever than I, thought of this. He then says that others are waging bets on whether he might subconsciously stutter. I grill him about his wardrobe, assuming he will be wearing a new Tom Ford tuxedo. He tells me both he and Ford will be in older Ford models. I tell him I made rich-butthrifty Charles Ferguson, director of Inside Job, spend $6,000 dollars for a new Tom Ford tux. In the back room, Jennifer Lopez is now seated with Weinstein’s wife, Georgina Chapman. Helena Bonham Carter, her live-in-lover Tim Burton and her mother Elena circulate. Star power includes Adrien Brody, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Cameron Diaz, Camilla Belle, Chace Vera Farmiga Adrien Brody Andrew Garfield Oliver Stone and Tara Stone Claire Danes and Hugh Dancy Hailee Steinfeld Taylor Swift Donald and Melania Trump Donna Karan Lynn Wyatt Barry Diller Jon Hamm and Jennifer Westfeldt Anderson Cooper Chloe Malle and Candice Bergen Diane von Furstenberg Tory Burch Crawford, Claire Danes and Hugh Dancy, Darren Aronofsky, director John Wells, Kerry Washington, Piers Morgan, Rachel Zoe, Sean Parker, Zack Braff and Leonardo Dicaprio with Bar Rafaeli. Speech filmmakers are functioning on high anxiety. SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 27 Producer Donna Gigliotti is my date to the awards. We are both so nervous we arrive at the Kodak Theater at 3 p.m. and nobody is there. We are driven around for an hour. When we arrive back at the world’s most famous red carpet, I guide Donna through security check-in to the extreme right to make sure we get on camera. I teach her the red carpet hustle, which is five steps forward, three steps back, one inch behind a couture-clad nominee. We greet Kevin Huvane as Sandra Bullock is talking to ABC-TV and a billion people see me wearing a black Marchesa gown. Five steps forward, three steps back, we next meet Gwyneth Paltrow, and I hook up the back of her dress while another billion people see me correct the fashion malfunction. Five steps forward, three steps back, we’re now posing behind Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban. Our Blackberrys begin buzzing; the world has seen us. James Franco and Anne Hathaway are hip hosts. This is the year of no surprises. But it isn’t until Hilary Swank yells out Hooper’s name for Best Director that Harvey’s gang finally realizes they are getting the Oscar for Best Picture after all. Harvey is sitting in Spielberg’s seat as Spielberg announces the win from the stage. Producers Iain Canning, Emile Sherman and Gareth Unwin leap up and kiss each other.Six months of grueling work have finally paid off. King George VI and Harvey Weinstein now share the journey of a single man who triumphs over adversity. At the Governor’s ball, held above the Kodak Theater, the winners triumphantly sachet around the room holding their heavy eight-pound gold statues. An hour later there is a migration to the Vanity Fair party hosted by Graydon Carter at Jeff Klein’s Sunset Tower Hotel. The invitation features a gold hologram that transmits a radio frequency of a photo and details about the guest to VF staff as they arrive. The next day “Page Six” will report that the backup private security firm is run by a former Israeli operative, when in fact they are Irish Catholics from Staten Island. There’s a hierarchy of arrival times. At 5 p.m. the inner circle of Graydon’s 141 best friends attend a seated dinner. They include Barry Diller and Diane von Furstenberg, Francis Ford Coppola, Jon Hamm and Jennifer Westfeldt, Betsey Bloomingdale, Tory Burch and Lyor Cohen, Carolina and Reinaldo Herrera, L’Wren Scott and Sir Mick Jagger, Naomi Watts and Liev Schreiber, Wendi Stark, George Hamilton, Judd Apatow, Jackie and Joan Collins, Donna Karan and Steve Martin. The best and the brightest talent in town arrive at 9 p.m. Every single winner shows up. Also there are Justin Bieber and his date Selena Gomez, Michelle Williams, Emma Stone, Steve Tyler and Liv Tyler, Andrew Garfield, Jude Law, Armie Hammer, Vera Farmiga, Kevin Spacey, Charlize Theron, Anne Hathaway, Winter’s Bone star-of-tomorrow Jennifer Lawrence, Taylor Hackford and Helen Mirren, Scarlett Johansson, Isla Fischer and Sasha Baron Cohen, Tom Hanks, Sean Penn, Renee Zellweger and Bradley Cooper and Jane Fonda after her play, 33 Variations. I introduce Melania and Donald Trump to David O. Russell as The Trumpster gushes about The Fighter. David tells Donald he used to be a waiter/bar tender at many of Trump’s parties. Donald smiles as if looking at yet another apprentice. He then offers me a ride home on his plane; he’s leaving in 10 minutes. Too bad James Franco didn’t know because he is presently sitting on a commercial flight back to school, skipping his own after-party. The rest of the guests’ social standings are determined by half-hour increments. VF’s Beth Kseniak, Matt Ullian and Jane Sarkin tell me the list is cut down to 800 this year. At 11:30 p.m. there is another celebrity migration up the hill to Madonna manager Guy Oseary’s house. Earlier in the I introduce Melania and Donald Trump to David O. Russell . . . David tells Donald he used to be a waiter/bar tender at many of Trump’s parties. Donald smiles as if looking at yet another apprentice. evening, Madonna came down the hill to pose in a risqué see-thru outfit with daughter Lourdes. Madonna and co-host Demi Moore are able to lure the crème de la crème with the promise of dancing and no cameras. MONDAY, FEBRUARY 28 A winner’s work is never done. Colin Firth, Tom Hooper and David Seidler show up at 4:30 a.m. at The Four Seasons Hotel for a live broadcast on “The Today Show.” Functioning on an adrenalin rush, they return to the Kodak Theater with Geoffrey Rush to appear on Oprah’s live broadcast. By the end of this year’s thrilling race between two great producers—Scott Rudin and Harvey Weinstein— Facebook and Twitter are credited for aiding political justice from the streets of Cairo to Tripoli. But the British film with the most heart wins as one single human voice can still make a difference. The king has spoken. ✦ Fran Lebowitz Julie Chen Ellen Barkin Naomi Watts Joan Collins Chace Crawford", "metadata": {"source_filename": "TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012700.txt", "parent_doc_id":

Wouldn’t this be a bet- ter course than Introduction to Physics? The teachers could introduce whatever aspects of physics they wanted to help students understand the predictive process in that area, but other faculty who did predic- tion in other areas would be part of the discussion. There would be a set of interesting issues ranging from predictions that were thought to be right but weren't, to predictions that are being made today in each area. The content would be the predictive process itself, not the traditional subject matter. Statistics (and other useful tools) would be taught in this context while the predictive process was being studied. Modeling. Who build models? Psychologists think about models of the mind, as do computer scientists and philosophers who specialize in thinking about thinking. Architects and economists build models of a different sort. Engineers work with models regularly. All of these people use different modeling tools but they work on the same thing: trying to figure out how something works by building it and seeing if they can replicate it. They may be using a computer or building blocks or electricity or art. It makes no difference. It is all an attempt to see how things work by building some facsimile. This is an important idea in human thinking, and a course should be taught to undergraduates on how to do it by the people who actually do it, teaching different techniques as they go. They are many ways to build a model, and students in college should know the possibilities before they take on further study. Experimentation. Psychologists do experiments. Chemists do experiments. Physicists do experiments. Medical researchers do experiments. (The drug companies are constantly doing experiments that affect us all.) Why is there no course in learning how to do an experiment? Shouldn't students be learning how to come up with a hypothesis and how to test that hypothesis? Isn’t that more important as a fundamental building block of the mind than any course offered to freshmen in college today? Evaluation. Every academic field does evaluation.

Neither the General Partner nor the Management Company is currently expected to register as an investment adviser with the SEC in reliance on the venture capital fund exemption. The General Partner may need to take into consideration certain conditions regarding the nature of investments that may be made by investment vehicles advised by an investment adviser relying on the venture capital exemption, which may constrain the Fund’s investment flexibility or require certain non-qualifying investments to be disposed of earlier than they might otherwise be. In addition, compliance with the venture capital fund exemption may subject the Fund to limitations on the Fund’s operations, including limitations on the Fund’s ability to borrow, provide guarantees and make short-term investments that are more restrictive than any limitation set forth in the Partnership Agreement. Reliance on the venture capital exemption also will necessitate reporting certain information to the SEC about the Management Company, the General Partner and their affiliates and may result in such entities being subject to SEC examination authority and certain Advisers Act compliance obligations. If the General Partner and the Management Company are able to rely on the venture capital exemption, investors in the Fund will not be entitled to the benefits of certain protections under the Advisers Act. If the General Partner or the Management Company cannot rely on the venture capital exemption, the General Partner or the Management Company may need to register as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Registration under, and compliance with, the Advisers Act could be costly and could divert attention of the Fund’s management team. There also can be no assurance that statutory, regulatory, judicial or administrative interpretations of existing laws and regulations will not in the future impose more comprehensive or stringent requirements on the General Partner or the Management Company.

Luckily for Epstein, Ric Bradshaw, the sheriff in charge of local jails, transfers Epstein to the infirmary, where he spends exactly one night before being transferred seven miles up the 4 a road to a much smaller, safer location: the Palm Beach County i Central Detention Center—or, as it’s known, the Stockade.

Petitioners do not contend that Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4’s “participation in this case” can only be achieved by listing them as parties. As it stands under the original petition, the merits of this case will be decided based on a determination of whether the Government violated the rights of Jane Doe 1, Jane Doe 2, and all “other similarly situated victims” under the CVRA. Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 may offer relevant, admissible, and non-cumulative evidence that advances that determination, but their participation as listed parties is not necessary in that regard. See Herring, 894 F.2d at 1024 (District court did not abuse its discretion by denying amendment where “addition of more plaintiffs .. . would not have affected the issues underlying the grant of summary judgment.”’); cf. Arthur v. Stern, 2008 WL 2620116, at *7 (S.D. Tex. 2008) (Under Rule 15, “courts have held that leave to amend to assert a claim already at issue in [another lawsuit] should not be granted if the same parties are involved, the same substantive claim is raised, and the same relief is sought.”).° And, as to Jane Doe 4 at least, adding her as a party raises unnecessary questions about whether she is a proper party to this action.° Petitioners also admit that amending the petition to conform to the evidence—by including references to the non-prosecution agreement itself—is “unnecessary” as the “existing petition is broad enough to cover the developing evidence in this case.” (DE 311). The Court > The Court expresses no opinion at this time whether any of the attestations made by Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 in support of their motion will be relevant, admissible, and non- cumulative. ° The Government contends that Jane Doe 4 is not a true “victim” in this case because she was not known at the time the Government negotiated the non-prosecution agreement, and accordingly she was not entitled to notification rights under the CVRA. (See DE 290 at 10). Any “duplicative” litigation filed by Jane Doe 4 would necessarily raise the issue of whether she has standing under the CVRA under these circumstances. 9 HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014855", "metadata": {"source_filename": "IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014855.txt", "parent_doc_id": "IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014855.txt", "chunk_index": 0, "entities": ["BenDs6edmémieieh", "CVRA Jane Doe", "Petitioners", "Arthur", "S.D Tex", "District", "Jane Doe", "Under Rule", "And", "Any", "ALB De/dk4i", "Case", "Government", "CVRA", "CVRA See DE", "The Court", "The Government", "HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014855", "See Herring", "F.2d", "Stern", "T5é6cK AWK"]}}], "reference_answer": {"text": "The timeline of individuals waiting to appear in court could impact the determination of the Government's violation of rights under the CVRA by potentially delaying the legal proceedings and affecting the timely resolution of the case for Jane Doe 1, Jane Doe 2, and other victims.

[jeeyacation@gmail.com] Subject: Trump appears with mobster-affiliated felon at New Year's bash/Joe Cinque Importance: High Jeffrey --I thought you might be interested in this article-- Nick Trump appears with mobster-affiliated felon at New Year's bash President-elect Donald Trump rang in the new year together with Joseph \"Joey No Socks\" Cinque — a convicted felon with ties to notorious Gambino crime family boss John Gotti, a recently released video has revealed. Cinque can be seen in a video obtained by the Palm Beach Daily News , cheering loudly as a tuxedo-clad Trump runs through a number of campaign promises before the hundreds of guests attending the New Year's Eve bash the President-elect threw at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Saturday. \"The taxes are coming down, regulations are coming off, we're going to get rid of Obamacare,\" Trump can be heard saying as an exuberant Cinque stands next to him, pumping his fists into the air. Cinque's Sunday appearance with Trump might raise some eyebrows. Beyond a 1989 felony conviction for possessing nearly $100,000 worth of stolen artwork, Cinque \"used to be friends with John Gotti,\" according to a New York Magazine profile from 1995 . Cinque was also \"shot three times and left for dead\" in a 1980 incident that authorities described as \"a hit,\" according to the profile. Further, Saturday's Mar-a-Lago party was far from the first time Cinque cheered on for Trump. An Associated Press report from this spring showed that the American Academy of Hospitality Sciences, a company owned and operated by Cinque, has awarded more than a dozen of Trump's golf courses, hotels, casinos and private clubs with so-called \"Star Diamond\" awards \"of true excellence in hospitality.\" The same report also found that about half of the roughly 30 people listed as \"trustees\" to the company are Trump friends or business associates. Trump, meanwhile, was listed on the company's website as its \"ambassador extraordinaire,\" and he even appeared in a 2009 tribute video to Cinque in which he said, \"There's nobody like him. He's a special guy.\" But when asked by reporters about Cinque in May, Trump denied knowing anything about him or his criminal past. \"If a guy's going to give you an award, you take it,\" the President-elect said at the time. \"You don't tend to look up his whole life story.\" The Trump transition team did not immediately return a request for comment on how the President-elect knows Cinque or why they appeared together Saturday. While standing alongside Cinque, Trump also took a moment to address the terror attack that left scores of nightclub revelers in Istanbul dead over the weekend — and how the bloodbath somehow necessitates a Mexican border wall. \"We will build a wall, you know that. We will build a wall,\" the President-elect told the raucous crowd. HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033210 \"And speaking of walls,\" he continued. \"In Turkey tonight — has anybody heard? Big disaster took place in Turkey tonight. Many, many, many people killed...It's a horror show. So we're going to get things running properly.\" ISIS claimed responsibility for the Saturday attack , which left at least 39 people dead and dozens more wounded, calling the lone gunman who carried out the massacre a \"heroic soldier of the caliphate.\" The suspect had yet to be named and located by Turkish authorities early Tuesday. The President-elect made building a wall along the country's southern border one of his main campaign talking points, frequently promising his supporters that it will be a \"great\" and \"beautiful\" wall. But his pledge to construct a border barrier has gone under several renditions, with the President-elect admitting in November that it might actually end up \"part wall, part fence.\" HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033211", "metadata": {"source_filename": "TEXT-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_033210.txt", "parent_doc_id": "TEXT-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_033210.txt", "chunk_index": 0, "entities": ["New York Magazine", "Nick Trump", "He's", "There's", "Cinque Trump", "Tuesday The President-elect", "Cinque", "Cinque Importance High Jeffrey", "Saturday The", "You", "Subject Trump", "President-elect", "New Year's", "Turkey", "Palm Beach Daily News", "Big", "Turkish", "Trump An Associated Press", "Hospitality Sciences", "And", "Star Diamond", "Saturday While", "Mar-a-Lago", "Further Saturday's Mar-a-Lago", "Joseph Joey No Socks Cinque", "American Academy", "November", "Cinque's Sunday", "ISIS", "Obamacare Trump", "Beyond", "But", "President-elect Donald Trump", "The Trump", "New Year's Eve", "Mexican", "HOUSE OVERSIGHT", "Many", "May Trump", "Trump", "From Nicholas Ribis____________________________________________ Sent", "Saturday", "Trump's", "John Gotti", "Gambino", "Istanbul", "Florida"]}}], "reference_answer": {"text": "Human cash flow (F) is influenced by the pay (z) received, which can be allocated towards invested consumption (C_).

Klobuchar is the daughter of Rose (née Heuberger) and Jim Klobuchar. She has one younger sister. Her parents divorced when Klobuchar was 15. Klobuchar attended public schools in Plymouth and was valedictorian at Wayzata High School. In 1982, she graduated from Yale magna cum laude with a B.A. in political science. During college, she was a member of the Yale College Democrats, the Feminist Caucus, and the improv troupe Suddenly Susan. During her time at Yale, Klobuchar spent time as an intern for then Vice President, and former Minnesota Senator, Walter Mondale.

These are the dimensions associated with emotion, and when taken away, cause us to perceive the other as an object. Since objects can’t feel pain or joy, we can’t share in their experience because they lack experience altogether. If that is the case, then when we perceive any human group that has been dehumanized in this particular way, there should be little to no activity in those areas of the brain associated with thinking, feeling, wanting, and believing. To explore this possibility, the social psychologist Susan Fiske placed subjects in a brain scanner and presented photographs of either extreme out-group members, such as the homeless and drug addicts, or photographs of other groups such as the elderly, middle-class Americans, and the rich. When viewing the extreme out-group, not only did Fiske see little activity in an area critically related to self-awareness and the process of thinking about others thoughts and emotions — the medial prefrontal cortex — but she also observed an intense increase of activity in the insula, a brain area that is recruited when we experience disgust. Fiske’s results highlight the dangers of dehumanization. Once we turn off areas of the brain that are involved in thinking about others’ thoughts and emotions, and turn on areas involved in disgust, we have set ourselves up for moral disengagement. As the distinguished American psychologist Albert Bandura has documented through decades of research, moral disengagement allows people to justify harm by transforming lethal motives into morally justified and even benevolent ones. Moral disengagement allows us to excuse ourselves from moral responsibility, either disregarding the harm imposed or convincing ourselves that it was justified, even obligatory. In several international studies of school-aged children, results consistently show that those who are most morally disengaged are most likely to engage in various forms of aggression, including bullying and repeated criminal offenses. These same children are also least likely to engage in helpful behavior, revealing that moral disengagement dispenses with the typical process of self-censure and sanctioning that we carry around when we are morally engaged. Ina study of American prison personnel involved in death penalty sentences, executioners were more morally disengaged than support staff or prison guards. Executioners were more likely to dehumanize the convicted prisoner and provide moral and economic justifications. Executioners also felt less guilt because they had developed a narrative to justify their actions, one that ascribed complete fault and responsibility to the victim. Support staff flipped in the opposite direction, fully involved with the weighty moral issues associated with ending someone’s life. In a study of people’s political attitudes, those with strong right wing authoritarian views, commonly associated with fascism and submission to authority, were more likely to support war by means of morally disengaging. In particular, they were most likely to support war by justifying its necessity and trivializing the harm that will necessarily arise — for Hauser Chapter 3.

[jeeyacation@gmail.com] Subject: Trump appears with mobster-affiliated felon at New Year's bash/Joe Cinque Importance: High Jeffrey --I thought you might be interested in this article-- Nick Trump appears with mobster-affiliated felon at New Year's bash President-elect Donald Trump rang in the new year together with Joseph \"Joey No Socks\" Cinque — a convicted felon with ties to notorious Gambino crime family boss John Gotti, a recently released video has revealed. Cinque can be seen in a video obtained by the Palm Beach Daily News , cheering loudly as a tuxedo-clad Trump runs through a number of campaign promises before the hundreds of guests attending the New Year's Eve bash the President-elect threw at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Saturday. \"The taxes are coming down, regulations are coming off, we're going to get rid of Obamacare,\" Trump can be heard saying as an exuberant Cinque stands next to him, pumping his fists into the air. Cinque's Sunday appearance with Trump might raise some eyebrows. Beyond a 1989 felony conviction for possessing nearly $100,000 worth of stolen artwork, Cinque \"used to be friends with John Gotti,\" according to a New York Magazine profile from 1995 . Cinque was also \"shot three times and left for dead\" in a 1980 incident that authorities described as \"a hit,\" according to the profile. Further, Saturday's Mar-a-Lago party was far from the first time Cinque cheered on for Trump. An Associated Press report from this spring showed that the American Academy of Hospitality Sciences, a company owned and operated by Cinque, has awarded more than a dozen of Trump's golf courses, hotels, casinos and private clubs with so-called \"Star Diamond\" awards \"of true excellence in hospitality.\" The same report also found that about half of the roughly 30 people listed as \"trustees\" to the company are Trump friends or business associates. Trump, meanwhile, was listed on the company's website as its \"ambassador extraordinaire,\" and he even appeared in a 2009 tribute video to Cinque in which he said, \"There's nobody like him. He's a special guy.\" But when asked by reporters about Cinque in May, Trump denied knowing anything about him or his criminal past. \"If a guy's going to give you an award, you take it,\" the President-elect said at the time. \"You don't tend to look up his whole life story.\" The Trump transition team did not immediately return a request for comment on how the President-elect knows Cinque or why they appeared together Saturday. While standing alongside Cinque, Trump also took a moment to address the terror attack that left scores of nightclub revelers in Istanbul dead over the weekend — and how the bloodbath somehow necessitates a Mexican border wall. \"We will build a wall, you know that. We will build a wall,\" the President-elect told the raucous crowd. HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033210 \"And speaking of walls,\" he continued. \"In Turkey tonight — has anybody heard? Big disaster took place in Turkey tonight. Many, many, many people killed...It's a horror show. So we're going to get things running properly.\" ISIS claimed responsibility for the Saturday attack , which left at least 39 people dead and dozens more wounded, calling the lone gunman who carried out the massacre a \"heroic soldier of the caliphate.\" The suspect had yet to be named and located by Turkish authorities early Tuesday. The President-elect made building a wall along the country's southern border one of his main campaign talking points, frequently promising his supporters that it will be a \"great\" and \"beautiful\" wall. But his pledge to construct a border barrier has gone under several renditions, with the President-elect admitting in November that it might actually end up \"part wall, part fence.\" HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033211", "metadata": {"source_filename": "TEXT-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_033210.txt", "parent_doc_id": "TEXT-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_033210.txt", "chunk_index": 0, "entities": ["New York Magazine", "Nick Trump", "He's", "There's", "Cinque Trump", "Tuesday The President-elect", "Cinque", "Cinque Importance High Jeffrey", "Saturday The", "You", "Subject Trump", "President-elect", "New Year's", "Turkey", "Palm Beach Daily News", "Big", "Turkish", "Trump An Associated Press", "Hospitality Sciences", "And", "Star Diamond", "Saturday While", "Mar-a-Lago", "Further Saturday's Mar-a-Lago", "Joseph Joey No Socks Cinque", "American Academy", "November", "Cinque's Sunday", "ISIS", "Obamacare Trump", "Beyond", "But", "President-elect Donald Trump", "The Trump", "New Year's Eve", "Mexican", "HOUSE OVERSIGHT", "Many", "May Trump", "Trump", "From Nicholas Ribis____________________________________________ Sent", "Saturday", "Trump's", "John Gotti", "Gambino", "Istanbul", "Florida"]}}], "reference_answer": {"text": "Cinque's past felony conviction for possessing stolen artwork and his association with John Gotti could make high-profile attorneys hesitant to represent him, as they may be concerned about the implications of his criminal history and connections to organized crime, which could reflect poorly on their practice and reputation.", "structured": null, "metadata": {}}}

[jeeyacation@gmail.com] Subject: Trump appears with mobster-affiliated felon at New Year's bash/Joe Cinque Importance: High Jeffrey --I thought you might be interested in this article-- Nick Trump appears with mobster-affiliated felon at New Year's bash President-elect Donald Trump rang in the new year together with Joseph \"Joey No Socks\" Cinque — a convicted felon with ties to notorious Gambino crime family boss John Gotti, a recently released video has revealed. Cinque can be seen in a video obtained by the Palm Beach Daily News , cheering loudly as a tuxedo-clad Trump runs through a number of campaign promises before the hundreds of guests attending the New Year's Eve bash the President-elect threw at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Saturday. \"The taxes are coming down, regulations are coming off, we're going to get rid of Obamacare,\" Trump can be heard saying as an exuberant Cinque stands next to him, pumping his fists into the air. Cinque's Sunday appearance with Trump might raise some eyebrows. Beyond a 1989 felony conviction for possessing nearly $100,000 worth of stolen artwork, Cinque \"used to be friends with John Gotti,\" according to a New York Magazine profile from 1995 . Cinque was also \"shot three times and left for dead\" in a 1980 incident that authorities described as \"a hit,\" according to the profile. Further, Saturday's Mar-a-Lago party was far from the first time Cinque cheered on for Trump. An Associated Press report from this spring showed that the American Academy of Hospitality Sciences, a company owned and operated by Cinque, has awarded more than a dozen of Trump's golf courses, hotels, casinos and private clubs with so-called \"Star Diamond\" awards \"of true excellence in hospitality.\" The same report also found that about half of the roughly 30 people listed as \"trustees\" to the company are Trump friends or business associates. Trump, meanwhile, was listed on the company's website as its \"ambassador extraordinaire,\" and he even appeared in a 2009 tribute video to Cinque in which he said, \"There's nobody like him. He's a special guy.\" But when asked by reporters about Cinque in May, Trump denied knowing anything about him or his criminal past. \"If a guy's going to give you an award, you take it,\" the President-elect said at the time. \"You don't tend to look up his whole life story.\" The Trump transition team did not immediately return a request for comment on how the President-elect knows Cinque or why they appeared together Saturday. While standing alongside Cinque, Trump also took a moment to address the terror attack that left scores of nightclub revelers in Istanbul dead over the weekend — and how the bloodbath somehow necessitates a Mexican border wall. \"We will build a wall, you know that. We will build a wall,\" the President-elect told the raucous crowd. HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033210 \"And speaking of walls,\" he continued. \"In Turkey tonight — has anybody heard? Big disaster took place in Turkey tonight. Many, many, many people killed...It's a horror show. So we're going to get things running properly.\" ISIS claimed responsibility for the Saturday attack , which left at least 39 people dead and dozens more wounded, calling the lone gunman who carried out the massacre a \"heroic soldier of the caliphate.\" The suspect had yet to be named and located by Turkish authorities early Tuesday. The President-elect made building a wall along the country's southern border one of his main campaign talking points, frequently promising his supporters that it will be a \"great\" and \"beautiful\" wall. But his pledge to construct a border barrier has gone under several renditions, with the President-elect admitting in November that it might actually end up \"part wall, part fence.\" HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033211", "metadata": {"source_filename": "TEXT-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_033210.txt", "parent_doc_id": "TEXT-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_033210.txt", "chunk_index": 0, "entities": ["New York Magazine", "Nick Trump", "He's", "There's", "Cinque Trump", "Tuesday The President-elect", "Cinque", "Cinque Importance High Jeffrey", "Saturday The", "You", "Subject Trump", "President-elect", "New Year's", "Turkey", "Palm Beach Daily News", "Big", "Turkish", "Trump An Associated Press", "Hospitality Sciences", "And", "Star Diamond", "Saturday While", "Mar-a-Lago", "Further Saturday's Mar-a-Lago", "Joseph Joey No Socks Cinque", "American Academy", "November", "Cinque's Sunday", "ISIS", "Obamacare Trump", "Beyond", "But", "President-elect Donald Trump", "The Trump", "New Year's Eve", "Mexican", "HOUSE OVERSIGHT", "Many", "May Trump", "Trump", "From Nicholas Ribis____________________________________________ Sent", "Saturday", "Trump's", "John Gotti", "Gambino", "Istanbul", "Florida"]}}], "reference_answer": {"text": "Cinque's past felony conviction for possessing stolen artwork and his association with John Gotti could make high-profile attorneys hesitant to represent him, as they may be concerned about the implications of his criminal history and connections to organized crime, which could reflect poorly on their practice and reputation.", "structured": null, "metadata": {}}}

This much we know - the Fall elections are shaping up to be a referendum on the most divisive American President in memory. The battle for potential Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh's nomination this fall will only amplify the polarity of the political debate that is already deeply overwrought on both sides. The rising tide of pressure on Donald Trump from the Mueller investigation shows no sign of ebbing. Unless the underlying political dynamics are disrupted, the outcomes of these unprecedented events will still leave us with the same unsatisfactory two front battlefield of the 2016 Presidential election. Watching these unrelenting, compounding events since our discussion in May, I am guessing we are all asking the same question: now what? For the 48 percent of Americans who believe Donald Trump should not be in the White House, perhaps we too want our own \"chaos\" candidate in 2020? Should Trump run again, this could be a \"break glass\" moment for the majority of Americans who don't support him. Do we want to break the genteel precedents of two parties running their ceremonious and seemingly illogical nominating process to select a candidate? (Why do Iowa and New Hampshire play such outsized roles? What kind of small-d democratic process relies on superdelegates?) The system failed in 2016, with both parties producing terribly flawed candidates in a race to the bottom. We need to build a back-up plan in the event the system fails again. HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026499 It's possible, of course, that we won't need a third-party candidate. Trump could decide not to run for whatever reason. The Democrats could nominate a winning 2020 candidate. I am not willing to take those bets. The ideal candidate for a new third party is someone who is widely perceived to be that rare combination of both good and great. We are looking for a proven leader of men and women, someone with clear, democratic — and moral — values that reflect the best of America, not our worst. We know people like this on the national stage now. As a thought experiment, consider the possibilities of a ticket outside the partisan lanes and imagine the chemistry of radical combinations: Biden/Romney? Bill Gates/Hogan? Bloomberg/Haley? Howard Schultz/Bob Corker? Sandberg/Kasich? As we have discussed narrow path to electing the first president outside the two major party primary system in 168 years is more navigable than most think. Heading into 2020, converging trends in American's demands for a third party (a historic high of 61%), disapproval of Donald Trump holding steady above 50%, and the increasingly leftward drift of the Democratic Party suggest that electorate may be susceptible to merits of a new centrist party. Cynics will say that the structural impediments of ballot and presidential debate access, the overwhelming advantages of legacy parties' fundraising and voter turn-out operations preordain failure, but they're wrong; the legal and logistical hurdles are amenable to a combination of lawyering and resources. The bigger, more consequential factors come in terms of candidate quality and policy. I believe a candidate with five specific characteristics including a unique — and purposefully non-specific - policy agenda could limbo a win. • This is what I think a successful third-party candidate looks like; a dream third party ticket would start off with enough name ID to be an instant contender. Building the name ID to run nationally is just too long and expensive of a process to accomplish in the 28 months until the next presidential election. We can't beat a celebrity without some celebrity of our own, whether from politics, sports, business, or entertainment. Instantaneous name ID is so crucial because the candidate must HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026500 start out in striking distance in any three-way poll against Trump and a fill-in-the-blank Democratic flavor-of-the day candidate. The media and political class will predetermine irrelevance otherwise. • A Democrat-leaning candidate would have to top the ideal third-party ticket. We need someone with a shot at snaking a plurality of the vote in the blue states Hillary Clinton won (227 electoral votes), but moderate enough to win a plurality in some combination of Trump states like Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan (another 119 votes). The right candidate may even to put North Carolina, Ohio, Indiana in play for a centrist bi-partisan ticket as well (totaling an electoral sweep of 464 elector votes). A right leaning candidate would meet the same fate as a primary challenger to Trump — for all intents and purposes we need to assume that 36% of voters won't be cleaved from Trump under any circumstances and run to win around them. The deep red states would be off the table entirely. • With the Trump reality show airing daily, voters are now expecting to take their politics with a side of entertainment. Heretofore, ratings will matter no matter how dry the policy topic. Surely Stephen Colbert would gladly sacrifice his executive producer Chris Licht to produce a daily comedic segment of this dream candidate interviewing Americans in truck stops and McDonald's across the country. A few of the \"Saturday Night Live\" script writers could certainly be enticed to disguise serious debates as informative amusement. Any candidate must be committed to a near daily cadence of high quality, compelling video production. It will be especially crucial to keep the voters' attention during what will be a raucous Democratic primary season. Rules governing access to the general election debate stage dictate that a candidate enjoy support of at least 15% of voters in the months leading up to the general election. • This dream candidate would pledge to serve only four years and address all of the U.S.'s ticking time bombs like Social Security, Medicare, health care reform, climate change, money in politics, gerrymandering, and infrastructure investment in a single term. This one-and-done term decouples our candidate from the usual politics and gives them the power of promise and deliver decisive action. A four-year term pledge ensures governance independent of campaign finance concerns and HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026501 narrow special interests inherent to winning re-election. This \"fix-it\" ticket would promise to force decisions on all the underlying structural policy matters damaging America's long-term prospects and distorting our democracy. No more kicking the can down the road. • This candidate should also pledge to push for laws passed that reflect the will of simple majorities in Congress. Congress now only allows bills to move forward when a \"majority of a majority\" supports the policy and on many levels seems fundamentally broken. This third-party president could force votes based on a transparent reading of where the votes lie via coalition building. The Senate filibuster power will present a high hurdle, but a third-party candidate would be a de facto disruptor of the two-party system. Party discipline could well break down, and moderates in both parties could form a powerful, decisive block willing to work with the new President. The policies passed into law may not be ideal for either Democrats or Republicans, but for the major agenda items that must be addressed for America's long-term health, an imperfect fix that corrects course is better than those that now have us hurtling toward national bankruptcy. And if no candidate secures 270 electoral votes in 2020? The House of Representatives would choose the next president. In 2016, reports suggested Michael Bloomberg declined to run on a third-party ticket for fear of splitting support from Hillary Clinton and throwing the election to a GOP-controlled House of Representatives who would then vote to select the president. The fear was the GOP controlled House would have just elected Trump. Would Democratic control of the House mean that the House would pick an alternative to Trump as president? Each state delegation has a single vote in selecting a president and it is the incoming Congress - the class elected in 2020 that would decide the election. But no matter which party has the speaker's chair, the GOP would almost certainly have the upper hand in the majority of state delegations controlled. Would the state delegations pick a president based on party majority control of the delegation, the winner of the popular vote in each state or their own calculations as to who is best for America? Precedent suggests that delegations use secret ballots, which means individual lawmakers may vote their consciences. HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026502 If we recruit this ideal candidate; threading the needle of name ID, a center-left bent, a TV- savvy campaign team and a pledge to serve only four years with an apartisan agenda, money and campaign expertise would certainly follow. And 50 state ballot access is a function of time (starting in the fall of 2019 would be prudential) and hard work as we have discussed and many of you have exhaustively war- gamed. Part and parcel of this effort would be motivating the often politically lackadaisical middle to vote. The raft of new technologies in data targeting and biometric mobile voting technology could transform the electorate in the next few, amping voter participation and injecting the voices of moderates (both in political views and level of political interest) into the process. And any third-party effort must incorporate advocacy for accelerated adaption of these all but inevitable voter verification tools. I believe Silicon Valley could be game-changing allies in this effort. I am sure none of us doubt that chaos could potentially be unleashed by jamming three viable candidates into a two-party system. An election that ends up in the House of Representatives is an uncontrollable, murky and ancient process. But might that be a less scary prospect than relying on the Democrats to nominate a candidate who can beat Trump in 2020?

In February, the Miami Herald filed a federal court motion in the Southern District of New York, seeking access to documents that were sealed in the Maxwell case. The motion, which was not opposed by Roberts, could have cast light on the full scope of Epstein’s possible sex trafficking operation, who was involved and whether it was covered up. Maxwell has opposed the Herald’s motion, which was denied in August. The Herald is appealing. Today, Epstein has a new private jet, which takes him around the world. Flight records show that he spends most of his time on his private island, Little St. James in the U.S. Virgin Islands, which he now lists as his permanent residence. He is registered in New York and the U.S. Virgin Islands as a sex offender. New Mexico, where he owns a sprawling ranch, does not list him as a convicted sex offender. As part of its investigation, the Herald learned that in 2013, the federal government conceded that it had given Epstein what it called “valuable consideration” for information he provided to the FBI as part of his plea deal.

In February, the Miami Herald filed a federal court motion in the Southern District of New York, seeking access to documents that were sealed in the Maxwell case. The motion, which was not opposed by Roberts, could have cast light on the full scope of Epstein’s possible sex trafficking operation, who was involved and whether it was covered up. Maxwell has opposed the Herald’s motion, which was denied in August. The Herald is appealing. Today, Epstein has a new private jet, which takes him around the world. Flight records show that he spends most of his time on his private island, Little St. James in the U.S. Virgin Islands, which he now lists as his permanent residence. He is registered in New York and the U.S. Virgin Islands as a sex offender. New Mexico, where he owns a sprawling ranch, does not list him as a convicted sex offender. As part of its investigation, the Herald learned that in 2013, the federal government conceded that it had given Epstein what it called “valuable consideration” for information he provided to the FBI as part of his plea deal.
